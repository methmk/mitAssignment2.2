3 INTRODUCTION

```
Firstly, thank you for picking up this
book. It has been written with two very
different types of people in mind:
```

● (^) Those who want to learn how to design and build websites
from scratch
● (^) Anyone who has a website (that may be built using a
content management system, blogging software, or an
e-commerce platform) and wants more control over the
appearance of their pages
The only things you need in order to use this book are a
computer with a web browser and a text editor (such as
Notepad, which comes with Windows, or TextEdit, which
comes with Macs).

```
INTRODUCTION 4
```

**Introduction** pages come at the beginning of each
chapter. They introduce the key topics you will learn
about.

```
Reference pages introduce key pieces of HTML &
CSS code. The HTML code is shown in blue and CSS
code is shown in pink.
```

**Background** pages appear on white; they explain the
context of the topics covered that are discussed in
each chapter.

```
Diagram and infographics pages are shown on a
dark background. They provide a simple, visual
reference to topics discussed.
```

**Example** pages put together the topics you have
learned and demonstrate how they can be applied
in each.

```
Summary pages come at the end of each chapter.
They remind you of the key topics that were covered
in each chapter.
```

5 INTRODUCTION

```
At work, when people look
at my screen and see it full of
code, it's not unusual to get a
comment about it looking very
complicated or how clever I must
be to understand it. The truth
is, it's not that hard to learn how
to write web pages and read
the code used to create them;
you certainly don't have to be a
"programmer."
```

```
Understanding HTML and CSS
can help anyone who works
with the web; designers can
create more attractive and
usable sites, website editors can
create better content, marketers
can communicate with their
audience more effectively, and
managers can commission
better sites and get the best out
of their teams.
```

```
I've focussed on the code you
need to use 90% of the time
and omitted the code that you
would rarely see even if writing
websites is your full time job. By
the end of the book, if you come
across the other 10% you will be
able to Google it to find out what
it means quickly and easily.
```

```
I have also added practical
information on topics I am
commonly asked about, such as
how to prepare images, audio
and video for the web, how to
approach the design and build
of a new site, how to improve
your rankings in search engines
(SEO), and how to use Google
Analytics to learn about visitors
to your site.
```

```
Many books that teach HTML and CSS
resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for
you to learn, we threw away the traditional
template used by publishers and redesigned
this book from scratch.
```

Is I t hard to Learn?

```
INTRODUCTION 6
```

1: ht ML

We will spend the first chapter
looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages. You will see
that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear
on your page. You then add tags
or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is
a heading, where a paragraph
begins and ends, and so on.

The rest of this section
introduces the tags you have
at your disposal to create web
pages, grouped into chapters on:
text, lists, links, images, tables,
forms, video audio and flash, and
miscellaneous elements.

I should warn you that the
examples in the first nine
chapters are not exciting to look
at, yet they are the foundation of
every web page. The following
chapters on CSS will show you
how to make your pages look a
lot more interesting.

```
2: css
We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to
look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties
generally fall into one of two
categories:
```

```
Presentation: How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages (or
parts of a page), and how to add
background images.
```

```
Layout: How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen. You
will also learn several techniques
that professionals use to make
their pages more attractive.
```

```
3: PractIca L
We end up with some helpful
information that will assist you in
building better websites.
```

```
We look at some new tags that
will be introduced in HTML5 to
help describe the structure of
your pages. HTML5 is the latest
version of HTML (still under
development at the time of
writing). Before learning about
these elements, you need a good
grasp of how CSS is used to
control the design of web pages.
There is a chapter that talks you
through a design process that
you might like to follow when
creating a new website.
```

```
Finally, we end up looking at
topics that will help you once
you have built your site, such
as putting it on the web, search
engine optimisation (SEO) and
using analytics software to track
who comes to your site and what
they are looking at.
```

```
In order to teach you about creating web pages,
this book is divided into three sections:
```

the s tructure of

t hI s Book

7 INTRODUCTION

```
Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
```

```
In order to view a web page,
users might type a web address
into their browser, follow a
link from another site, or use a
bookmark.
```

```
Software manufacturers
regularly release new versions
of browsers with new features
and supporting new additions
to languages. It is important,
however, to remember that
many computer owners will not
be running the latest versions
of these browsers. Therefore
you cannot rely on all visitors to
your site being able to use the
latest functionality offered in all
browsers.
```

```
You will learn how to tell which
browsers visitors use to access
your website in Chapter 19.
```

```
weB s ervers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.
```

```
Web servers are special
computers that are constantly
connected to the Internet, and
are optimized to send web pages
out to people who request them.
```

```
Some big companies run their
own web servers, but it is more
common to use the services of
a web hosting company who
charge a fee to host your site.
```

```
dev Ices
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.
```

```
screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.
```

```
In the same way that many
countries have legislations
that require public buildings
to be accessible to those with
disabilities, many laws have
also been passed that require
websites be accessible to those
with disabilities.
```

```
Throughout this book you will
see several references to screen
readers. These notes will help
ensure that the sites you create
are accessible to people who use
such software.
```

```
It is interesting to note that
technologies similar to those
employed by screen readers are
also being used in other areas
where people are unable read a
screen, such as when they are
driving or jogging.
```

```
Before we look at the code used to build
websites it is important to consider the
different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology.

what you see

When you are looking at a
website, it is most likely that
your browser will be receiving
HTML and CSS from the web
server that hosts the site. The
web browser interprets the
HTML and CSS code to create
the page that you see.

Most web pages also include
extra content such as images,
audio, video, or animations and
this book will teach you how to
prepare them for use on the web
and then how to insert them into
your web pages.

Some sites also send JavaScript
or Flash to your browser, and you
will see how to add JavaScript
and Flash in your web pages.
Both of these technologies are
advanced topics that you can go
on to learn more about once you
have mastered HTML and CSS, if
you want to.

```
how It I s c reated
Small websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS.
```

```
Larger websites — in particular
those that are updated regularly
and use a content management
system (CMS), blogging tools, or
e-commerce software — often
make use of more complex
technologies on the web server,
but these technologies are
actually used to produce HTML
and CSS that is then sent to the
browser. So, if your site uses
these technologies, you will be
able to use your new HTML and
CSS knowledge to take more
control over how your site looks.
```

```
Larger, more complex sites like
these may use a database to
store data, and programming
languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
Java, or Ruby on the web server,
but you do not need to know
these technologies to improve
what the user sees. The skills
you'll learn in this book should be
enough to help you on that road.
```

```
ht ML5 & css 3
Since the web was first created
there have been several versions
of HTML and CSS — each
intended to be an improvement
on the previous version.
```

```
At the time of writing this
book, HTML5 & CSS3 were
still being developed. Although
they had not been finalized,
many browsers were already
supporting some features of
these languages and a lot of
people were using the latest
code on their websites. I have
therefore chosen to teach you
these latest versions.
```

```
Because HTML5 and CSS
build on previous versions of
these languages, learning these
means you will also be able to
understand the earlier versions
of them. I have added clear notes
when the code is new and also
when it might not work in older
browsers.
```

```
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.
```

9 INTRODUCTION

```
On this page you can see
examples that demonstrate
how the web server that hosts
the website you are visiting can
be anywhere in the world. It is
the DNS servers that tell your
browser how to find the website.
```

● (^) A user in Barcelona visits
**sony.jp** in Tokyo
● (^) A user in New York visits
**google.com** in San Francisco
● (^) A user in Stockholm visits
**qantas.com.au** in Sydney
● (^) A user in Vancouver visits
**airindia.in** in Bangalore
On the right you can see what
happens when a web user in
England wants to view the
website of the Louvre art gallery
in France which is located at
**[http://www.louvre.fr](http://www.louvre.fr)**. Firstly, the
browser in Cambridge contacts
a DNS server in London. The
DNS server then tells the
browser the location of the web
server hosting the site in Paris.
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

PARIS

LONDON

Cambridge

The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users.

```
The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.
```

When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site;
for example: **google.com** ,
**bbc.co.uk** , **microsoft.com**.

```
Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.
An IP address is a number
of up to 12 digits separated
by periods / full stops. Every
device connected to the web
has a unique IP address; it is
like the phone number for that
computer.

13 STRUCTURE

```
We come across all kinds of documents
every day of our lives. Newspapers,
insurance forms, shop catalogues... the
list goes on.
```

```
Many web pages act like electronic versions of these
documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories
in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance
over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce
facilities.
```

```
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents. In this chapter you will:
```

● (^) See how HTML describes the structure of a web page
● (^) Learn how tags or elements are added to your document
● (^) Write your first web page

STRUCTURE 14

15 STRUCTURE

```
Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers
understand the stories in the
newspaper.
```

```
The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website.
```

```
Now think about a very different
type of document — an
insurance form. Insurance forms
often have headings for different
sections, and each section
contains a list of questions with
areas for you to fill in details or
checkboxes to tick. Again, the
structure is very similar online.
```

STRUCTURE 16

17 STRUCTURE

```
The use of headings and
subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of
information. For example, a
document might start with
a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most
important information.
```

```
This might be expanded upon
under subheadings lower down
on the page. When using a word
processor to create a document,
we separate out the text to give
it structure. Each topic might
have a new paragraph, and each
section can have a heading to
describe what it covers.
```

```
On the right, you can see a
simple document in Microsoft
Word. The different styles for
the document, such as different
levels of heading, are shown
in the drop down box. If you
regularly use Word, you might
have also used the formatting
toolbar or palette to do this.
```

Structuring word

STRUCTURE 18

19 STRUCTURE

```
On the previous page you saw
how structure was added to
a Word document to make it
easier to understand. We use
structure in the same way when
writing web pages.
```

```
STRUCTURE 20
```

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.

You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what
the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next
page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen
is in black.

\*\*<html>

<body>
<h1>** This is the Main Heading **</h1>
<p>** This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings. **<p>
<h2>** This is a Sub-Heading **</h2>
<p>** Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings). **</p>
<h2>** Another Sub-Heading **</h2>
<p>** Here you can see another sub-heading. **</p>
</body>
</html>**

The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets — these are called HTML **elements**. Elements are usually
made up of two **tags** : an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

Words between **<h1>** and **</h1>** are a main heading.

A paragraph of text appears between these **<p>** and **</p>** tags.

Words between **<h2>** and **</h2>** form a sub-heading.

Here is another paragraph between opening **<p>** and closing **</p>** tags.

```
Here an attribute called lang is
used to indicate the language

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are

Language. The HyperText part
refers to the fact that HTML
allows you to create links that
allow visitors to move from one

```
page to another quickly and
easily. A markup language allows
you to annotate text, and these
annotations provide additional
meaning to the contents of a
document. If you think of a web
```

```
page, we add code around the
original text we want to display
and the browser then uses
the code to display the page
correctly. So the tags we add are
the markup.
```

```
Anything written between the
<title> tags will appear in the
title bar (or tabs) at the top of
the browser window, highlighted
in orange here.
```

```
Anything written between
the <body> tags will appear
in the main browser window,
highlighted in blue here.

```
If you are working with a content
management system, blogging
platform, or e-commerce
application, you will probably
log into a special administration
section of the website to control
it. The tools provided in the
administration sections of these
sites usually allow you to edit
parts of the page rather than
the entire page, which means
you will rarely see the <html> ,
<head> , or <body> elements.
```

```
Looking at the content
management system on the
opposite page, you have a box
```

```
that allows you to enter a title
for the page, another box for the
main article, a way to enter a
publication date, and something
to indicate which section of the
site this page belongs in.
```

```
For an e-commerce store, you
might have boxes that allow you
to enter a title for the product,
a description of the product, its
price, and the quantity available.
```

```
That is because they use a single
'template' to control all of the
pages for a section of the site.
(For example, an e-commerce
```

```
system might use the same
template to show all of their
products.) The information
you supply is placed into the
templates.
```

```
The advantage of this approach
is that people who do not know
how to write web pages can
add information to a website
and it is also possible to change
the presentation of something
in the template, and it will
automatically update every page
that uses that template. If you
imagine an e-commerce store
with 1,000 items for sale, just
```

code in a content

management SyStem

```
STRUCTURE 34
```

altering one template is a lot
easier than changing the page
for each individual product.
In systems like this, when
you have a large block of text
that you can edit, such as a
news article, blog entry or the
description of a product in an
e-commerce store, you will often
see a text editor displayed.

Text editors usually have
controls a little like those on
your word processor, giving
you different options to style
text, add links or insert images.
Behind the scenes these editors

```
are adding HTML code to your
text, just like the code you have
seen earlier in this chapter.
Many of these editors will have
an option that allows you to see
(and edit) the code that they
produce.
```

```
Once you know how to read and
edit this code, you can take more
control over these sections of
your website.
```

```
In the example above, you can
see that the text editor has a tab
for Visual / HTML views of what
the user enters. Other systems
```

```
might have a button (which
often shows angle brackets) to
indicate how to access the code.
```

```
Some content management
systems offer tools that also
allow you to edit the template
files. If you do try to edit
template files you need to check
the documentation for your CMS
as they all differ from each other.
You need to be careful when
editing template files because
if you delete the wrong piece of
code or add something in the
wrong place the site may stop
working entirely.
```

```
When the web was first taking
off, one of the most common
ways to learn about HTML and
discover new tips and techniques
was to look at the source code
that made up web pages.
```

```
These days there are many
more books and online tutorials
that teach HTML, but you can
still look at the code that a web
server sends to you. To try this
out for yourself, simply go to the
sample code for this chapter, at
http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/
code/ and click on the link called
"View Source."
```

```
Once you have opened this
page, you can look for the View
menu in your browser, and select
the option that says Source or
View source. (The title changes
depending on what browser you
are using.)
```

```
You should see a new window
appear, and it will contain the
source code that was used to
create this page.
```

```
You can see this result in the
photograph on the right. The
page you see is the window at
the top; the code is below.
```

```
At first this code might look
complicated but don't be
discouraged. By the time you
have finished the next chapter
of this book, you will be able to
understand it.

All of the examples for this book
are on the website, and you can

X (^) HTML pages are text documents.
X (^) HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
X (^) Tags are often referred to as elements.
X (^) Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
X (^) Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
X (^) Attributes require a name and a value.

```
When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
```

```
In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that
appears on your pages. You will learn about:
```

● (^) **Structural markup:** the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
● (^) **Semantic markup:** which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

```
HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
```

```
<h1> is used for main headings
```

```
<h2> is used for subheadings
```

```
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so
on...
```

```
Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes. The
contents of an <h1> element is
the largest, and the contents of
an <h6> element is the smallest.
The exact size at which each
browser shows the headings
can vary slightly. Users can also
adjust the size of text in their
browser. You will see how to
control the size of text, its color,
and the fonts used when we
come to look at CSS.

To create a paragraph, surround

By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.
```

ParagraPHs

```
<p> A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
line. </p>
<p> Text is easier to understand when it is split up

technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.
```

**<b>**

```
By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.

```

```
In order to make code easier to
read, web page authors often
add extra spaces or start some
elements on new lines.
```

```
When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.
```

```
You will often see that web page
authors take advantage of white
space collapsing to indent their
code in order to make it easier
to follow.

To create a break between

```
There are a few elements that
do not have any words between
an opening and closing tag. They
are known as empty elements
and they are written differently.
```

```
An empty element usually
has only one tag. Before the
closing angled bracket of an
empty element there will often
be a space and a forward slash
character. Some web page
authors miss this out but it is a
good habit to get into.
```

As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show

Visual editors often resemble
word processors. Although
each editor will differ slightly,
there are some features that
are common to most editors
that allow you to control the
presentation of text.
```

● (^) Headings are created by
highlighting text then using
a drop-down box to select a
heading.
● (^) Bold and italic text are
created by highlighting some
text and pressing a **b** or **i**
button.
● (^) New paragraphs are created
using the return or the enter
key.
● (^) Line breaks are created by
pressing the shift key and the
return key at the same time.
● (^) Horizontal rules are created
using a button with a straight
line on it.
If you copy and paste text from
a program that allows you to
format text (such as Word) into
a visual editor, it may add extra
markup. To prevent this copy
the text into a plain text editor
first (such as Notepad on a PC
or TextEdit on a Mac) and then
copy it from that program and
paste it into the visual editor.
**Code views** show you the code
created by the visual editor so
you can manually edit it, or so
you can just enter new code
yourself. It is often activated
using a button with an icon
that says HTML or has angled
brackets. White space may be
added to the code by the editor
to make the code easier to read.
Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver
usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a
code view.

In the rest of the chapter you
will meet some more elements
that will help you when you are
adding text to web pages. For
example, you are going to meet
the **<em>** element that allows
you to indicate where emphasis
should be placed on selected
words and the **<blockquote>**
element which indicates that a
block of text is a quotation.

```
Browsers often display the
contents of these elements in
a different way. For example,
the content of the <em>
element is shown in italics,
and a <blockquote> is usually
indented. But you should not
use them to change the way that
your text looks; their purpose is
to describe the content of your
web pages more accurately.
```

```
The reason for using these
elements is that other programs,
such as screen readers or search
engines, can use this extra
information. For example, the
voice of a screen reader may add
emphasis to the words inside
the <em> element, or a search
engine might register that your
page features a quote if you use
the <blockquote> element.
```

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the

structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the

pages — they are known as semantic markup.

There are two elements
commonly used for marking up

```

**<blockquote>**

```
The <blockquote> element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. Note
how the <p> element is still
used inside the <blockquote>
element.
```

```
Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the <blockquote>
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS.
```

**<q>**

```
The <q> element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the <q> element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the <q> element.

Both elements may use the cite
attribute to indicate where the
quote is from. Its value should
be a URL that will have more

63 LISTS

```
There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
```

● (^) **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
● (^) **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
● (^) **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

**<ol>**

```
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
```

**<li>**

```
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
```

```
Browsers indent lists by default.
```

```
Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ol>
element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters,
roman numerals and so on). It
is better to use the CSS list-
style-type property covered
on pages 333-335.
```

```

**<dl>**

```
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
```

```
Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.
```

**<dt>**

```
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
```

**<dd>**

```
This is used to contain the
definition.
```

```
Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
term.
```

You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sub-
list or nested list.

Browsers display nested lists
indented further than the parent
list. In nested unordered lists,
the browser will usually change
the style of the bullet point too.

```
Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.
```

```
You will commonly come across the following types of links:
```

● (^) Links from one website to another
● (^) Links from one page to another on the same website
● (^) Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
● (^) Links that open in a new browser window
● (^) Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
```

```

```

```

```
LINKS 78
```

The text between the opening
**<a>** tag and closing **</a>** tag
is known as link text. Where
possible, your link text should
explain where visitors will be
taken if they click on it (rather
than just saying "click here").
Below you can see the link to
IMDB that was created on the
previous page.

```
Many people navigate websites
by scanning the text for links.
Clear link text can help visitors
find what they want. This
will give them a more positive
impression of your site and may
encourage them to visit it for
longer. (It also helps people
using screen reader software.)
```

```
To write good link text, you can
think of words people might
use when searching for the
page that you are linking to.
(For example, rather than write
"places to stay" you could use
something more specific such as
"hotels in New York.")

**<a> chapter-04/linking-to-other-sites.html HtMl**

```
Links are created using the <a>
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.
```

```
Users can click on anything that
appears between the opening
<a> tag and the closing </a>
tag and will be taken to the page
specified in the href attribute.
```

```
When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.
```

```
Browsers show links in blue with
an underline by default.
```

Linking to other sites

```
URL stands for Uniform
Resource Locator. Every web
page has its own URL. This is the
web address that you would type
into a browser if you wanted to
visit that specific page.
```

```
An absolute URL starts with
the domain name for that site,
and can be followed by the path
to a specific page. If no page is
specified, the site will display the
homepage.

**R e s u lt**

**<a>**

```
When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.
```

```
If all the pages of the site are in
the same folder, then the value
of the href attribute is just the
name of the file.
```

```
If you have different pages of a
site in different folders, then you
can use a slightly more complex
syntax to indicate where the
page is in relation to the current
page. You will learn more about
these on the pages 81-84.
```

```
If you look at the download
code for each chapter, you will
see that the index.html file
contains links that use relative
URLs.
```

```
Relative URLs help when building
a site on your computer because
you can create links between
pages without having to set up
your domain name or hosting.
```

```
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="index.html"> Home </a></li>

When linking to other pages

a shorthand version of absolute
URLs because you do not need
to specify the domain name.
```

```
We will take a closer look at
relative URLs on pages 83-84
as there are several helpful
shortcuts you can use to write
links to other pages on your own
website.

structure
The diagram on the right shows
the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
website called ExampleArts.
```

```
The top-level folder is known
as the root folder. (In this
example, the root folder is called
examplearts .) The root folder
contains all of the other files and
folders for a website.
```

```
Each section of the site is placed
in a separate folder; this helps
organize the files.
```

```
reLA tionshiPs
The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree.
```

```
In the diagram on the right, you
can see some relationships have
been drawn in.
```

```
The examplearts folder is a
parent of the movies , music
and theater folders. And the
the movies , music and theater
folders are children of the
examplearts folder.
```

```
homePAges
The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.
```

```
Web servers are usually set up
to return the index.html file if no
file name is specified.
```

```
Therefore, if you enter
examplearts.com it will return
examplearts.com/index
.html , and examplearts.com/
music will return examplearts
.com/music/index.html.
```

```
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.
```

Directory structure

```
If you are working with a content
management system, blogging
software, or an e-commerce
system, you might not have
individual files for each page of
the website.
```

```
Instead, these systems often
use one template file for each
different type of page (such as
news articles, blog posts, or
products).
```

```
Editing the template file would
change all of the pages that use
that template. Do not change
any code that is not HTML or
you may break the page.
```

```
LINKS 82
```

Every page and every image on
a website has a **uRl** (or Uniform
Resource Locator). The URL is
made up of the domain name
followed by the **path** to that page
or image.

```
The path to the homepage of this
site is http://www.examplearts
.com/index.html. The path
to the logo for the site is
examplearts.com/images/
logo.gif.
```

```
You use URLs when linking
to other web pages and when
including images in your own
site. On the next page, you will
meet a shorthand way to link to
files on your own site.
```

The root folder contains:

● (^) A file called _index.html_ which
is the homepage for the
entire site
● (^) Individual folders for the
movies, music and theatre
sections of the site
Each sub-directory contains:
● (^) A file called _index.html_ which
is the homepage for that
section
● (^) A reviews page called _reviews
.html_
● (^) A listings page called _listings
.html_ (except for the DVD
section)
The movies section contains:
● (^) A folder called _cinema_
● (^) A folder called _DVD._

83 LINKS

```
When you are linking to a page
on your own website, you do
not need to specify the domain
name. You can use relative uRls
which are a shorthand way to tell
the browser where a page is in
relation to the current page.
```

```
This is especially helpful when
creating a new website or
learning about HTML because
you can create links between
pages when they are only on
your personal computer (before
you have got a domain name and
uploaded them to the web).
```

```
Because you do not need to
repeat the domain name in each
link, they are also quicker to
write.
```

```
If all of the files in your site are
in one folder, you simply use the
file name for that page.
```

```
If your site is organized into
separate folders (or directories),
you need to tell the browser
how to get from the page it is
currently on to the page that you
are linking to.
```

```
If you link to the same page from
two different pages you might,
therefore, need to write two
different relative URLs.
```

```
These links make use of the
same terminology (borrowed
from that of family trees) you
met on the previous page which
introduces directory structure.
```

```
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

When a website is live (that
is, uploaded to a web server)
you may see a couple of other
techniques used that do not
work when the files are on your
local computer.

```
For example, you may see the
name of a child folder without
the name of a file. In this case
the web server will usually try
to show the homepage for that
section.
```

```
A forward slash will return the
homepage for the entire site,
and a forward slash followed
by a file name will return that
file providing it is in the root
directory.

```
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.
```

```
One of the most common
reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened
in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases,
they hope the user will return
to the window containing their
site after finishing looking at the
other one.
```

```
Generally you should avoid
opening links in a new window,
but if you do, it is considered
good practice to inform users
that the link will open a new
window before they click on it.

At the top of a long page
you might want to add a list
of contents that links to the
corresponding sections lower
down. Or you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top.
```

```
Before you can link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element). You can see that the
<h1> and <h2> elements in this
example have been given id
attributes that identify those
sections of the page.
```

```
The value of the id attribute
should start with a letter or an
underscore (not a number or
any other character) and, on a
single page, no two id attributes
should have the same value.
```

```
To link to an element that uses
an id attribute you use the <a>
element again, but the value of
the href attribute starts with
the # symbol, followed by the
value of the id attribute of the
element you want to link to. In
this example, <a href="#top">
links to the <h1> element at
the top of the page whose id
attribute has a value of top.

If you want to link to a specific

technique.
```

```
As long as the page you are
linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the
page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the
link for that page.
```

```
Therefore, the href attribute
will contain the address for the
page (either an absolute URL or
a relative URL), followed by the
# symbol, followed by the value
of the id attribute that is used on
the element you are linking to.
```

For example, to link to the

```
There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.
```

```
There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:
```

● (^) Include an image in your web pages using HTML
● (^) Pick which image format to use
● (^) Show an image at the right size
● (^) Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster
You can also use CSS to include images in your pages using the
**background-image** property, which you will meet on pages
413-420.

IMAGES 96

97 IMAGES

```
Images can be used to set the
tone for a site in less time than
it takes to read a description. If
you do not have photographs
to use on your website, there
are companies who sell stock
images ; these are images you
```

```
pay to use (there is a list of stock
photography websites below).
Remember that all images are
subject to copyright, and you
can get in trouble for simply
taking photographs from
another website.
```

```
If you have a page that shows
several images (such as product
photographs or members of a
team) then putting them on a
simple, consistent background
helps them look better as
a group.
```

```
A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.
```

As a website grows, keeping
images in a separate folder
helps you understand how the
site is organized. Here you can
see an example of the files for
a website; all of the images are
stored in a folder called **_images_**.

```
On a big site you might like to
add subfolders inside the images
folder. For example, images such
as logos and buttons might sit in
a folder called interface , product
photographs might sit in a page
called products , and images
related to news might live in a
folder called news.
```

```
If you are using a content
management system or blogging
platform, there are usually tools
built into the admin site that
allow you to upload images,
and the program will probably
already have a separate folder
for image files and any
other uploads.

**<img> chapter-05/adding-images.html HtMl**

```
To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
```

```
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images — relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
```

```
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
```

```
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.
```

add Ing Images

```
The text used in the alt attribute
is often referred to as alt text.
It should give an accurate
description of the image content
so it can be understood by
screen reader software (used by
people with visual impairments)
and search engines.
```

```
If the image is just to make a
page look more attractive (and
it has no meaning, such as a
graphic dividing line), then the
alt attribute should still be used
but the quotes should be left
empty.
```

IMAGESIMAGES 100100

**R e s u lt**

```
You will also often see an <img>
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:
```

```
height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
```

```
width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
```

```
Images often take longer to
load than the HTML code that
makes up the rest of the page.
It is, therefore, a good idea to
specify the size of the image
so that the browser can render
the rest of the text on the page
while leaving the right amount of
space for the image that is still
loading.
```

```
The size of images is increasingly
being specified using CSS rather
than HTML — see pages 409-
410 for more information about
this.

```
Where you place the image in
the code is important because
browsers show HTML elements
in one of two ways:
```

```
Block elements always appear
on a new line. Examples of block
elements include the <h1> and
<p> elements.
```

```
If the <img> is followed by a
block level element (such as a
paragraph) then the block level
element will sit on a new line
after the imageas shown in the
first example on this page.
```

```
Inline elements sit within a
block level element and do not
start on a new line. Examples of
inline elements include the <b> ,
<em> , and <img> elements.
```

```
If the <img> element is inside a
block level element, any text or
other inline elements will flow
around the image as shown in
the second and third examples
on this page.

Block and inline elements are
discussed in greater depth on

align chapter-05/aligning-images-horizontally.html HtMl
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image. It has
been removed from HTML5
and new websites should use
CSS to control the alignment of
images (as you will see on pages
411-412).
```

```
I have discussed it here because
you are likely to come across
it if you look at older code, and
because some visual editors still
insert this attribute when you
indicate how an image should be
aligned.
```

```
The align attribute can take
these horizontal values:
```

```
left
This aligns the image to the left
(allowing text to flow around its
right-hand side).
```

```
right
This aligns the image to the right
(allowing text to flow around its
left-hand side).

When you give the align

text flows around it.
```

```
When you give the align

image is placed on the right and
the text flows around it.

When text flows right up to the

it harder to read. You will learn
how to add a gap between text

three rules for

CreatIng Images

There are three rules to remember when you
are creating images for your website which are
summarized below. We go into greater detail
on each topic over the next nine pages.
```

###### 1

```
saVe I mages In
the rIght format
```

```
Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.
```

###### 2

```
saVe I mages at
the rIght sIze
```

```
You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to
display on the page.
```

###### 3

```
use the CorreCt
resolutIon
```

```
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.
```

tools to edIt

& s aVe Images

```
The most popular tool amongst
web professionals is Adobe
Photoshop. (In fact, professional
web designers often use this
software to design entire sites.)
The full version of Photoshop is
expensive, but there is a cheaper
version called Photoshop
Elements which would suit the
needs of most beginners.

```

Whenever you have many different
colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
A photograph that features snow or an
overcast sky might look like it has large
areas that are just white or gray, but the
picture is usually made up of many different
colors that are subtly different.

When a picture has an area that is filled
with exactly the same color, it is known as
flat color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams
often use flat colors. (Note that photographs
of snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors,
they are made up of many subtly different
shades of the same color and are not as
suited to GIF or PNG format.)
```

Use GIF or PNG format

when saving images

with few colors or large

areas of the same color.

113 IMAGES

```
For example, if you have
designed a page to include an
image that is 300 pixels wide by
150 pixels tall, the image you use
should be 300 x 150 pixels. You
may need to use image editing
tools to resize and crop the

image. When sourcing images, it
is important to understand how
you can alter the dimensions of
an image; imagine that you had
designed a web page to include
an image that is 300 pixels wide
by 150 pixels tall:
```

```
The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.
```

```
reduCI ng I mage sIze
You can reduce the size of
images to create a smaller
version of the image.
```

```
example: If your image is 600
pixels wide and 300 pixels tall,
you can reduce the size of the
image by 50%.
```

```
Result: This will create an image
that is quicker to download.
```

```
InCreasIng I mage sIze
You can't increase the size of

increasing the size by 300%
would result in poor quality.
```

```
Result: The image will look
blurry or blocky.
```

```
ChangIng shape
Only some images can be
cropped without losing valuable
information (see next page).
```

```
example: If your image is 300
pixels square, you can remove
parts of it, but in doing so you
might lose valuable information.
```

```
Result: Only some images can
be cropped and still make sense.

115 IMAGES

```
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.
```

Image resolutIon

```
JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to
a type of image format known
as bitmap. They are made up of
lots of miniature squares. The
resolution of an image is the
number of squares that fit within
a 1 inch x 1 inch square area.
```

```
Images appearing on computer
screens are made of tiny squares
called pixels. A small segment
of this photograph has been
magnified to show how it is
made up of pixels. The web
browsers on most desktop
```

```
computers display images at a
resolution of 72 pixels per inch
(ppi). Images in print materials
(such as books and magazines)
are made up of tiny circles called
dots. These images are usually
printed at a resolution of 300
dots per inch (dpi).
```

```
For this image:
JPEG at 300 dpi = 1,526kb
JPEG at 72 ppi = 368kb
```

```
Due to the fact that computer
displays are capped at a
resolution of 72 ppi, using
images on the web with a higher
resolution will not result in better
image quality — only in larger
file sizes, which will increase the
time needed to load them and
therefore slow down viewing of
your web pages.
```

```
IMAGES 116
```

When an image is a line drawing
(such as a logo, illustration, or
diagram), designers will often
create it in vector format.
Vector formatted images are
very different to bitmap images.

```
Vector images are created by
placing points on a grid, and
drawing lines between those
points. A color can then be
added to "fill in" the lines that
have been created.
```

```
The advantage of creating line
drawings in vector format is that
you can increase the dimensions
of the image without affecting
the quality of it.
```

```
Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.
```

Ve Ctor Images

The current method of using
vector images for display on
websites involves saving a
bitmap version of the original
vector image and using that.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
are a relatively new format used
to display vector images directly
on the web (eliminating the need
to create bitmap versions of
them), however its use is not yet
widespread.

117 IMAGES

```
Below you can see the individual
frames that make up an
animated GIF that shows an
orange dot revolving around
a circle — like the kind of
animation you might see when a
web page is loading.
```

```
Some image editing applications
such as Adobe Photoshop allow
you to create animated GIFs.
There are several tutorials about
how to do this on the web. There
are also several websites that
allow you to upload the graphics
for the individual frames and
create the animated GIF for you.
```

```
It I s I mportant to
remember:
```

```
Each extra frame of the image
increases the size of the file, and
can therefore add to the time it
takes for an image to download
(and web users do not like
waiting a long time for images to
download).
```

```
Because GIFs are not an
ideal format for displaying
photographs, animated GIFs are
really only suitable for simple
illustrations.
```

```
Some designers frown on
animated GIFs because they
remember a lot of amateur web
designers overusing them in the
1990's.
```

```
Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

selecting one of two formats:
```

```
If the transparent part of the
image has diagonal or rounded
edges or if you want a semi-
opaque transparency or a drop-

save it as a PNG.

Transparent PNGs are not fully
supported in older browsers,

Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
```

```
You can have more than one
image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share
the same caption.
```

**<figcaption>**

```
The <figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
```

```
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an <img> element with
its caption.
```

```
Older browsers that do not
understand HTML5 elements
simply ignore the new elements
and display the content of them.
```

html5: fI gure and

fI gure CaptIon

```
In this example, the logo is a GIF
because it uses flat colors, while
the photographs are JPEGs. The
main photo is placed inside the
HTML5 <figure> element and
has its own caption.
```

```
The alt attribute on each
image provides a description
for those using screen readers
and the title attribute provides
additional information. (This is
shown in the tooltip.)

This example does not
use the height , width , or
align attributes as these are
being phased out and you
are encouraged to use CSS
properties instead.

The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
```

**<tr>**

```
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
```

```
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
```

```
At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.
```

**<td>**

```
Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
```

```
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.
```

```
Some browsers automatically
draw lines around the table
and/or the individual cells. You
will learn how to control the
borders of tables using CSS on
pages 309-312 and 337-340.

**<th>**

```
The <th> element is used just
like the <td> element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)
```

```
Even if a cell has no content,
you should still use a <td> or
<th> element to represent
the presence of an empty cell
otherwise the table will not
render correctly. (The first cell
in the first row of this example
shows an empty cell.)
```

```
Using <th> elements for
headings helps people who
use screen readers, improves
the ability for search engines
to index your pages, and also
enables you to control the
appearance of tables better
when you start to use CSS.
```

```
You can use the scope attribute
on the <th> element to indicate
whether it is a heading for a
column or a row. It can take the
values: row to indicate a heading
for a row or col to indicate a
heading for a column.
```

```
Browsers usually display the
content of a <th> element in
bold and in the middle of the cell.
```

```
<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th scope="col"> Saturday </th>
<th scope="col"> Sunday </th>

Table headings

133 TA B L E S

```
Sometimes you may need the
entries in a table to stretch
across more than one column.
```

```
The colspan attribute can be
used on a <th> or <td> element
and indicates how many columns
that cell should run across.
```

```
In the example on the right
you can see a timetable with
five columns; the first column
contains the heading for that
row (the day), the remaining four
represent one hour time slots.
```

```
If you look at the table cell that
contains the words 'Geography'
you will see that the value of the
colspan attribute is 2 , which
indicates that the cell should run
across two columns. In the third
row, 'Gym' runs across three
columns.
```

```
You can see that the second
and third rows have fewer
<td> elements than there are
columns. This is because, when
a cell extends across more than
one column, the <td> or <th>
cells that would have been in the
place of the wider cells are not
included in the code.
```

```
I added some CSS styles to this
example so that you can see how
the cells span more than one
column. You will learn how to do
this on pages 250, 337-340.

You may also need entries in
a table to stretch down across
more than one row.
```

```
The rowspan attribute can be
used on a <th> or <td> element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.
```

```
In the example on the left you
can see that ABC is showing a
movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas
the BBC and CNN channels are
both showing two programs
during this time period (each of
which lasts one hour).
```

```
If you look at the last <tr>
element, it only contains three
elements even though there are
four columns in the result below.
This is because the movie in the
<tr> element above it uses the
rowspan attribute to stretch
down and take over the cell
below.
```

I have added some CSS styles to
this example so that you can see
how the cells span more than

There are three elements that
help distinguish between the
main content of the table and
the first and last rows (which can
contain different content).

```
These elements help people
who use screen readers and also
allow you to style these sections
in a different manner than the
rest of the table (as you will see
when you learn about CSS).
```

**<thead>**

The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead> element.

The body should sit inside the

Some of the HTML editors that
come in content management
systems offer tools to help
draw tables. If the first row of
your table only contains <th>
elements then you may find that
the editor inserts a <thead>
element automatically.
```

```
Part of the reason for having
separate <thead> and <tfoot>
elements is so that, if you have
a table that is taller than the
screen (or, if printed, longer than
one page) then the browser
can keep the header and footer
visible whilst the contents of
the table scroll. This is intended
to make it easier for users to
see which column the data is in
(however this functionality is not
implemented by default in any
current browser).
```

```
I have added some CSS styles
to this example so that you can
see the contents of the <thead>
and <tfoot> being treated
differently than the rest of the
rows. You will learn how to apply
these CSS styles to tables on
pages 309-312 and 337-340.

There are some outdated
attributes which you should not
use on new websites. You may,
however, come across some
of them when looking at older
code, so I will mention them
here. All of these attributes have
been replaced by the use of CSS.
```

```
The width attribute was used
on the opening <table> tag to
indicate how wide that table
should be and on some opening
<th> and <td> tags to specify
the width of individual cells.
The value of this attribute is
the width of the table or cell in
pixels.
```

```
The columns in a table need to
form a straight line, so you often
only see the width attribute on
the first row (and all subsequent
rows would use that setting).
```

```
The opening <table> tag could
also use the cellpadding
attribute to add space inside
each cell of the table, and the
cellspacing attribute to create
space between each cell of
the table. The values for these
attributes were given in pixels.
```

```
I added CSS styles to this
example so that you can see the
width of the table cells more
clearly. If you want to control
the width or spacing of tables
and cells you should use CSS as
shown on pages 303, 337-340.
```

The border attribute was used

The bgcolor attribute was used
to indicate background colors
of either the entire table or
individual table cells. The value
is usually a hex code (which we
discuss on pages 249-252).

This example uses the HTML
border and bgcolor attributes.
No CSS attributes were utilized
in this example.

A form may have several form controls, each

gathering different information. The server

needs to know which piece of inputted data

corresponds with which form element.

To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information
is sent from the browser to the server using name/value pairs. In this
example, the form asks for the visitor's username and also for their
favorite jazz musician. The name/value pairs sent to the server are:

You should never change the name of a form control in a page unless
you know that the code on the server will understand this new value.

**username=Ivy**

If the form control allows the
user to enter text, then the value
of the form control is whatever
the user has typed in.

**vote=Herbie**

```
If the form control allows you
to choose from a fixed set of
answers (e.g. radio buttons,
checkboxes or a drop down list),
the web page author will add
code that gives each option an
automatic value.

**<form>**

```
Form controls live inside a
<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.
```

```
action
Every <form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.
```

```
method
Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.
```

```
With the get method, the values
from the form are added to
the end of the URL specified in
the action attribute. The get
method is ideal for:
```

● (^) short forms (such as search
boxes)
● (^) when you are just retrieving
data from the web server
(not sending information that
should be added to or deleted
from a database)

**</p>

chapter-07/form-structure.html HtMl**
Form stru Ctur E
With the **post** method the
values are sent in what are
known as HTTP headers. As a
rule of thumb you should use the
**post** method if your form:
● (^) allows users to upload a file
● (^) is very long
● (^) contains sensitive data
(e.g. passwords)
● (^) adds information to, or
deletes information from, a
database
If the method attribute is not
used, the form data will be sent
using the **get** method.
**id**
We look at the **id** attribute on
page 183, but the value is used to
identify the form distinctly from
other elements on the page (and
is often used by scripts — such
as those that check you have
entered information into fields
that require values).

**<input>**

```

to create several different form
controls. The value of the type
attribute determines what kind
of input they will be creating.
```

```
type="text"
When the type attribute has a
value of text , it creates a single-
line text input.
```

```
name
When users enter information
into a form, the server needs to
know which form control each
piece of data was entered into.
(For example, in a login form, the
server needs to know what has
been entered as the username
and what has been given as the
password.) Therefore, each form
control requires a name attribute.
The value of this attribute
identifies the form control and is
sent along with the information
they enter to the server.
```

```
maxlength
You can use the maxlength
attribute to limit the number
of characters a user may enter
into the text field. Its value is the
number of characters they may
enter. For example, if you were
asking for a year, the maxlength
attribute could have a value of 4.
```

```

For example, a value of 3 would
create a box wide enough to
display three characters
```

```
(although a user could enter
more characters if they desired).
```

In any new forms you write,
CSS should be used to control
the width of form elements.

to be set up to communicate

```

```
Any text that appears between
the opening <textarea> and
closing </textarea> tags will
appear in the text box when the

If the user does not delete any
text between these tags, this

selected
The selected attribute can be
used to indicate the option that
should be selected when the
page loads. The value of this
attribute should be selected.
```

```
If this attribute is not used,
the first option will be shown
when the page loads. If the user
does not select an option, then
the first item will be sent to
the server as the value for this
control.
```

```
The function of the drop down
list box is similar to that of the
radio buttons (in that only one
option can be selected). There
are two key factors in choosing
which to use:
```

1. If users need to see all options
   at a glance, radio buttons are
   better suited.
2. If there is a very long list
   of options (such as a list of
   countries), drop down list boxes
   work better.

You can turn a drop down select

be the number of options you

Unfortunately, the way that

**<label>**

```
When introducing form controls,
the code was kept simple by
indicating the purpose of each
one in text next to it. However,
each form control should have
its own <label> element as this
makes the form accessible to
vision-impaired users.
```

```
The <label> element can be
used in two ways. It can:
```

1. Wrap around both the text
   description and the form input
   (as shown on the first line of the
   example to your right).
2. Be kept separate from the
   form control and use the **for**
   attribute to indicate which form
   control it is a label for (as shown
   with the radio buttons).

```
for
The for attribute states which
form control the label belongs to.
Note how the radio buttons use
the id attribute. The value of the
id attribute uniquely identifies an
element from all other elements
on a page. (The id attribute is
covered on page 183.)
```

```
The value of the for attribute
matches that of the id attribute
on the form control it is labelling.

id attributes can be used on any

element is used with a checkbox

on either the form control or the

easier to use. The position of the
label is very important. If users

You have probably seen forms
on the web that give users
messages if the form control has
not been filled in correctly; this is
known as form validation.
```

```
Traditionally, form validation
has been performed using
JavaScript (which is beyond the
scope of this book). But HTML5
is introducing validation and
leaving the work to the browser.
```

```
Validation helps ensure the
user enters information in a
form that the server will be able
to understand when the form
is submitted. Validating the
contents of the form before it is
sent to the server the helps:
```

● (^) Reduce the amount of work
the server has to do
● (^) Enables users to see if there
are problems with the form
faster than if validation were
performed on the server.

chapter-07/html5-form-validation.html HtMl**
html5: Form VAlIDA tIon
At the time of writing, only
Chrome and Opera supported
HTML5 validation, although other
browsers are expected to follow.
In order to support older browsers
(that do not understand HTML5),
web page authors are likely to
continue using JavaScript to
validate forms.
An example of HTML5 form
validation is the **required**
attribute, which can be used on
any form element that the user
is expected to fill in. This HTML5
attribute does not need a value,
but in HTML 4 all attributes must
have a value. So, some people give
this attribute a value of **required**.

Many forms need to gather
information such as dates, email
addresses, and URLs. This has
traditionally been done using
text inputs.

HTML5 introduces new form

way that some information is
gathered. Older browsers that
do not recognize these inputs
will just treat them as a single
line text box.

**type="date"**

```
If you are asking the user for a
date, you can use an <input>
element and give the type
attribute a value of date.
This will create a date input in
browsers that support the new
HMTL5 input types.

This example shows what the
date input looks like in the Opera
browser. The appearance of
the date input changes across
different browsers.

EXTRA MARKUP 178

179 EXTRA MARKUP

```
Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.
```

```
Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).
```

```
There have also been several
versions of each browser used to
view web pages, each of which
implements new code. Not all
web users, however, have the
latest browsers installed on
their computers, which means
that not everyone will be able to
view all of the latest features and
markup.
```

```
Where you should be
particularly aware of browsers
not supporting certain features,
I have made a note of this (as
you have seen with some of the
HTML5 elements introduced in
the Forms chapter — and as you
will see in the CSS chapters).
```

```
With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5
(which have been highlighted),
the elements you have seen in
this book were all available in
HTML 4.
```

```
Although HTML 4 had some
presentational elements to
control the appearance of pages,
authors are not recommended to
use them any more. (Examples
include the <center> element
for centering content on a
page, <font> for controlling
the appearance of text, and
<strike> to put a line through
the text — all of these can be
achieved with CSS instead.)
```

```
In 1998, a language called XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages. Since
HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that HTML 4 should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of XML and it was renamed
XHTML. This meant that
authors had to follow some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup. For example:
```

● (^) Every element needed a
closing tag (except for empty
elements such as **<img />** ).
● (^) Attribute names had to be in
lowercase.
● (^) All attributes required a value,
and all values were to be
placed in double quotes.
● (^) Deprecated elements should
no longer be used.
● (^) Every element that was
opened inside another
element should be closed
inside that same element.

```
EXTRA MARKUP 180
```

The examples in this book all
follow these strict rules of XML.

One of the key benefits of this
change was that XHTML works
seamlessly with other programs
that are written to create and
process XML documents.

It could also be used with other
data formats such as Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) — a
graphical language written in
XML, MathML (used to mark
up mathematical formulae), and
CML (used to mark up chemical
formulae).

In order to help web page
authors move to this new syntax,
two main flavors of XHTML 1.0
were created:

● (^) **Strict XHTML 1.0** , where
authors had to follow the rules
to the letter
● (^) **Transitional XHTML 1.0** ,
where authors could still use
presentational elements (such
as **<center>** and **<font>** ).
The transitional version of
XHTML was created because
it allowed authors to continue
to follow older practices (with a
less strict syntax) and use some
of the elements and attributes
that were going to be removed
from future versions of HTML.
There was also a third version
of XHTML 1.0 called **XHTML
1.0 Frameset** , which allowed
web page authors to partition
a browser window into several
"frames," each of which would
hold a different HTML page.
These days, frames are very
rarely used and are being phased
out.
In HTML5, web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced. At the time of
writing, the HTML5 specification
had not been completed, but
the major browser makers had
started to implement many of
the new features, and web page
authors were rapidly adopting
the new markup.
Despite the fact that HTML5
is not yet completed, you can
safely take advantage of the
new features of the language as
long as you endeavour to ensure
that users with older browsers
will be able to view your pages
(even though some of the extra
features will not be visible to
them).

If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
```

```
<!-- comment goes here -->
```

```
It is a good idea to add
comments to your code because,
no matter how familiar you
are with the page at the time
of writing it, when you come
back to it later (or if someone
else needs to look at the code),
comments will make it much
easier to understand.
```

```
Although comments are not
visible to users in the main
browser window, they can be
viewed by anyone who looks at
the source code behind the page.
```

```
On a long page you will often
see comments used to indicate
where sections of the page start
or end, and to pass on notes to
help anyone who is looking at
the code understand it.
```

```
Comments can also be used
around blocks of code to stop
that code from being displayed
in the browser. In the example on
the left, the email link has been
commented out.

chapter-08/id-attribute.html HTML
```

```
Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
```

```
As you will see when you
come to look at CSS in the next
section, giving an element a
unique identity allows you to
style it differently than any other
instance of the same element
on the page. For example,
you might want to assign one
paragraph within the page
(perhaps a paragraph containing
a pull quote) a different style
than all of the other paragraphs.
In the example on the right, the
paragraph with the id attribute
whose value is pullquote is
made uppercase using CSS.
```

```
If you go on to learn about
JavaScript (a language that
allows you to add interactivity to
your pages), id attributes can be
used to allow the script to work
with that particular element.
```

```
The id attribute is known as a
global attribute because it can
be used on any element.
```

id a ttributE

```
EXTRA MARKUPEXTRA MARKUP 184184
```

```
Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.
```

```
To do this you can use the
class attribute. Its value
should describe the class it
belongs to. In the example on
the left, key paragraphs have a
class attribute whose value is
important.
```

```
The class attribute on any
element can share the same
value. So, in this example, the
value of important could be
used on headings and links, too.
```

Class attributE

```
By default, using these attributes
does not affect the presentation
of an element. It will only change
their appearance if there is a CSS
rule that indicates it should be
displayed differently.
```

```
In this example, CSS has been
applied to make elements with
a class attribute whose value
is important uppercase, and
elements with a class attribute
whose value is admittance red.
```

```
If you would like to indicate that
an element belongs to several
classes, you can separate class
names with a space, as you can

The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
```

```
For example, you might create
a <div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a <div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
```

```
In a browser, the contents of
the <div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.
```

```
Using an id or class attribute
on the <div> element, however,
means that you can create
CSS style rules to indicate how
much space the <div> element
should occupy on the screen and
change the appearance of all the
elements contained within it.

An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
```

```
One common use of iframes
(that you may have seen on
various websites) is to embed
a Google Map into a page. The
content of the iframe can be any
html page (either located on the
same server or anywhere else on
the web).
```

```
An iframe is created using the
<iframe> element. There are a
few attributes that you will need
to know to use it:
```

```
src
The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.
```

```
height
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.

the width of the iframe in pixels.

scrolling
The scrolling attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In
HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates
whether the iframe should
have scrollbars or not. This is
important if the page inside the
iframe is larger than the space
you have allowed for it (using the
height and width attributes).
Scrollbars allow the user to move
around the frame to see more
content. It can take one of three
values: yes (to show scrollbars),
no (to hide scrollbars) and auto
(to show them only if needed).
```

```
frameborder
The frameborder attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In
HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates
whether the frame should have
a border or not. A value of 0
indicates that no border should
be shown. A value of 1 indicates
that a border should be shown.
```

seamless
In HTML5, a new attribute
called seamless can be applied
to an iframe where scrollbars
are not desired. The seamless
attribute (like some other new
HTML5 attributes) does not
need a value, but you will often

seamless. Older browsers
do not support the seamless
attribute.

```
The <meta> element lives
inside the <head> element and
contains information about that
web page.
```

```
It is not visible to users but
fulfills a number of purposes
such as telling search engines
about your page, who created
it, and whether or not it is time
sensitive. (If the page is time
sensitive, it can be set to expire.)
```

```
The <meta> element is an empty
element so it does not have a
closing tag. It uses attributes to
carry the information.
```

```
The most common attributes
are the name and content
attributes, which tend to be
used together. These attributes
specify properties of the entire
page. The value of the name
attribute is the property you
are setting, and the value of the
content attribute is the value
that you want to give to this
property.
```

```
In the first line of the example on
the opposite page, you can see a
<meta> element where the name
attribute indicates an intention
to specify a description for the
page. The content attribute is
where this description is actually
specified.
```

```
The value of the name attribute
can be anything you want it to
be. Some defined values for this
attribute that are commonly
used are:
```

```
description
This contains a description
of the page. This description
is commonly used by search
engines to understand what the
page is about and should be a
maximum of 155 characters.
Sometimes it is also displayed in
search engine results.

engines should add this page
to their search results or not. A
value of noindex can be used if
this page should not be added. A

193 EXTRA MARKUP

```
Therefore, if you want these
characters to appear on your
page you need to use what are
termed "escape" characters
(also known as escape codes or
entity references). For example,
to write a left angled bracket,
you can use either &lt; or
&#60;. For an ampersand, you
can use either &amp; or &#38;.
```

```
There are also special codes
that can be used to show
symbols such as copyright and
trademark, currency symbols,
mathematical characters, and
some punctuation marks. For
example, if you want to include a
copyright symbol on a web page
you can use either &copy; or
&#169;.
```

```
When using escape characters,
it is important to check the
page in your browser to ensure
that the correct symbol shows
up. This is because some fonts
do not support all of these
characters and you might
therefore need to specify
a different font for these
characters in your CSS code.

There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)

at how to use it in your web pages.

We then focus on how to add video and audio to your site,

FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO 202

203 FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO

```
Whether you are creating an
animation or a media player in
Flash, the files you put on your
website are referred to as Flash
movies.
```

```
If you want to create your
own Flash movie, you need to
purchase the Flash authoring
environment from Adobe.
```

```
There are, however, several
companies that offer Flash
animations and slideshows,
as well as video and audio
players that you can use without
purchasing this tool.
```

```
When you create a Flash file in
the Flash authoring environment,
it is saved with the .fla file
extension. In order to use this file
on a web page it has to be saved
in a different format known
as SWF. (It has the .swf file
extension.)
```

```
When you export the movie
into SWF format, Flash creates
code that you can use to embed
the Flash movie in your page.
Traditionally, this code used the
HTML <object> and <embed>
tags. However, now it is more
common to use JavaScript.
```

```
To view Flash, browsers need
to use a plugin (an extra piece
of software that runs in the
browser) called the Flash Player.
Statistics commonly indicate
that 98% of browsers on
desktop computers have the
Flash plugin installed. (The
percentage of mobiles and
tablets with it is much less.)
```

```
There is not space in this book
to teach you how to create Flash
movies (there are many books
devoted to that one topic), but
this chapter will show you how
to add Flash movies to your site.
```

```
Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very
popular tool for creating animations, and later
for playing audio and video in websites.
```

how Flash works

```
The Flash authoring environment
is used to create Flash Movies.
```

```
The .fla file is exported to .swf
format to use in a web page.
```

```
The .swf file is included in your
web page using JavaScript.
```

```
FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO 204
```

When Flash was first released,
it was developed to create
animations. The technology
quickly evolved, however, and
people started to use it to build
media players and even entire
websites.

Although Flash is still very
popular, in recent years people
have been more selective about
when they use it (and now rarely
consider building an entire
website in Flash).

Despite this, Flash does have a
future on the web because there
are some things it does very well,
such as creating animations.

```
There are several reasons why
fewer websites are using Flash
these days, including:
```

```
In 2005-6, a set of JavaScript
libraries were launched
(including Prototype,
script.aculo.us, and JQuery)
which made it easier for people
to create animated effects using
JavaScript.
```

```
When Apple launched the
iPhone in 2007 and later the
the iPad in 2010, they took the
decision not to support Flash.
```

```
There have been laws introduced
to ensure that websites are
usable by those with visual or
physical impairments — and
Flash has been criticized because
Flash content does not always
meet accessibility requirements.
```

```
In 2008, browsers started to
support HTML5 <video> and
<audio> tags. At the time of
writing, Flash is still a popular
way of playing video and audio
on the web but more and more
people are switching to HTML5.
```

```
(You will see how to use these
elements later in the chapter.)
```

```
Since 2005, a number of factors have meant
that fewer websites are written in Flash or even
use elements of Flash in their pages.

```

```
The most popular way of
adding Flash into a web page
is using JavaScript. There are
several scripts that allow you
to do this without an in-depth
understanding of the JavaScript
language.
```

```
The script we will be looking at
here is called SWFObject. You
can obtain a copy of it for free
from Google, and you can see
how we use it on the next page.
```

```
One advantage to using this
technique is that it allows
browsers to show alternative
content for users whose
browsers are not capable of
showing Flash.
```

```
This technique uses a <div>
element to create a space where
the Flash movie should sit.
The <div> element has an id
attribute whose value is used
by the SWFObject script. In this
example, the value of the id
attribute is bird.
```

```
Inside the <div> element you
can place the alternative content
for users who are not able to
play Flash.
```

adding a Flash moVie

To Your web Page

```
The SWFObject script will check
to see if the user's browser can
play the Flash movie. If it can, the
script will replace the content of
the <div> with the .swf file.
```

```
For users who cannot see the
Flash movie, you could show a
still from the movie instead. You
might also like to consider using
a text description of the Flash
file.
```

```
If you use a text description as
alternative content, then you can
achieve two further benefits:
```

1. The text can be accessed by
   those with visual and/or physical
   impairments who are not able to
   interact with the Flash file.
2. The text can be indexed by
   search engines (which are not as
   effective at indexing SWF files),
   increasing the chance that your
   content will be found.

**R e s uLT**

```
In this example, the SWFObject
script is hosted on Google's
servers. We include the script in
this web page using the first of
the two <script> elements.
```

```
The type attribute is used on the
<script> element to indicate
that the script inside is written
in JavaScript. The src attribute
tells the browser where to find
the script.
```

```
The second <script> element
is used to tell the browser about
the Flash movie, as well as which
element it should replace. This
element is actually telling the
SWFObject script five pieces
of information, which are in the
brackets:
```

1. The **location** of the **.swf** file:
   **flash/bird.swf**
2. The element that the Flash
   movie should **replace** , specified
   by the **value** of the **id** attribute
   on the **<div>** element:
   **bird**
3. The **width** of the Flash movie:
   **400 px**
4. The **height** of the Flash movie:
   **300 px**
5. The minimum **version** of the
   Flash player needed to view the
   movie:
   **Flash Player 8**

209 FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO

FormaTs

```
Movies are available in many
formats (BluRay, DVD, VHS,
to name a few). Online, there
are even more video formats
(including AVI, Flash Video,
H264, MPEG, Ogg Theora,
QuickTime, WebM, and
Windows Media).
```

```
Just as your DVD player won't
play a VHS cassette, browsers
differ in what video formats they
do and don't support.
```

```
In order for users to view your
video online, you may need to
convert it to another format.
```

```
The process of converting
a video into another format
is sometimes referred to as
"encoding" the video.
```

```
There are several apps available
on the web that enable you to
encode videos (such as http://www.
mirovideoconverter.com ).
```

Pla Yers / Plugins

```
Browsers were initially designed
to show text and images only.
For this reason, browsers built
prior to 2010 generally required
another program called a player
or plugin to to be installed in
order to play video content.
```

```
These players and plugins only
supported certain video formats.
```

```
Recently browsers have evolved
to support the HTML5 <video>
tag (which renders players and
plugins obsolete).
```

```
Unfortunately, however, you
cannot rely on every visitor to
your website having a recent
browser that supports this
new HTML5 element and the
browsers that do recognize the
<video> element require the
video to be encoded in different
formats.
```

aPProach

```
The easiest way to add video
to your site is to use a hosted
service such as YouTube or
Vimeo.
```

```
However, there are some cases
where using these services is
not appropriate (as you will see
on the next page) and you will
want to host the video on your
own site.
```

```
At the time of writing, to ensure
most people can play your
video content, it is considered
best practice to use the HTML5
<video> element for browsers
that support it, and also Flash
video for those that do not.This
means you would need to upload
any videos you want to show in
at least two different formats:
WebM and MP4.
```

```
To add video to your site, there are two key
issues to understand: file formats and video
players/plugins.

ad VanTages

Hosted video sites (such as
YouTube) provide players that
work with the majority of web
browsers.

You do not need to worry about
encoding your video since
these sites allow you to upload
your content in a range of
formats. Once uploaded, they
automatically convert your video
into the various formats required
by different browsers.

Web hosting companies often
charge extra if you use a lot of
bandwidth, and video files can
be quite large. Therefore, it can
cost you extra to host the videos
on your own site. If your video
is hosted on a site like YouTube
or Vimeo, however, you do not
need to pay for the bandwidth.

disadVanTages

```
Your video will be available on
the site of the hosted service,
so if you want the content to be
exclusively available on your site
(and not visible on other sites),
you need to host the video on
your own server and add your
own player into the page.
```

```
Some services will limit what
your video is allowed to include.
For example, most prohibit
the use of advertising within
the video you upload (which
prevents you from monetizing
that content).
```

```
Some hosted services will play
their own adverts before your
video will begin, or even overlay
them over the screen as your
video is playing. The quality of
video on some hosted services
can also be limited.
```

The alTernaTiVe

```
If you want to host video on your
own site - rather than a hosted
service - a lot more work is
involved in setting up your site to
play the video.
```

```
We will be looking at two
different ways that you can host
your own videos: using both
Flash Video and the HTML5
<video> element.
```

```
In order to ensure that the
maximum number of visitors to
your site can see the video, you
will need to use a combination of
both of these techniques.
```

211 FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO

```
There are three steps you need to follow to add
a Flash Video to your web page:
```

Pre Paring a Flash

Video For Your siTe

###### 1

```
conVer T Your Video
in To FlV FormaT
```

```
To play a Flash Video, you need
to convert your video into FLV
format. Since Flash 6, the Flash
authoring environment has come
with a Flash Video Encoder to
convert videos into FLV format.
```

```
Some Flash video players
also support a format called
H264 (and some video editing
programs export video in this
format).
```

```
Googling "FLV or H264
converters" will allow you to find
alternative encoding software.
```

###### 2

```
Fin d an FlV PlaYer T o
Pla Y T he Video
```

```
You'll need a player written in
Flash to play the FLV file. Its
purpose is to hold the FLV movie
and add controls such as
play/pause. Here are two sites
that offer FLV players:
```

```
http://www.osflv.com
http://www.longtailvideo.com
```

```
You do not need the Flash
authoring environment to use
either of these on your website.
```

###### 3

```
include The PlaYer &
Video in Your Page
```

```
You can include the player in
your page using a JavaScript
technique such as SWFObject,
which was mentioned earlier in
this chapter.
```

```
You will also need to tell the
player where it can find the video
file that you want it to play.
(Some players have advanced
features such as the ability
to create playlists of multiple
videos, or add a still picture
before the video plays.)
```

```
I have provided a sample FLV
file that you can use with the
download code on the website
(It is in a separate folder because
the video files are large.)
```

```
In the following example, we will
use the OS FLV player, which is
a free, open-source Flash Video
player. This is included in the
download code. It only supports
the FLV format (not H264).
```

```
In the following example, we will
also be using the SWFObject
JavaScript technique mentioned
on pages 207-208.
```

arT icle

```
FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIOFLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO 212212
```

```
This example uses the OS FLV
player to display a video called
puppy.flv , which has already
been convered into FLV format.
```

```
You have already seen how to
use SWFObject to embed a
basic animation in a page, but
sometimes Flash movies need
information in order for them
to work. In this example, the
video player needs to know the
path to the video it has to play,
so SWFObject uses JavaScript
variables to pass this information
to the Flash movie. These are
provided in the two lines of code
that start with var.
```

```
This particular player is not
expecting any information in the
flashvars variable, so that is
left empty.
```

```
The path to the movie is supplied
in the variable called params.
```

```
var params = {movie:
"../videos/puppy.flv"};
```

```
The line after the variables is
the one that tells the script to
replace the HTML element
with the video player. It is very
similar to the one you saw in the
earlier example that introduced
SWFObject.

The new HTML5 <video>
element is only supported by
recent browsers, so you cannot
just use this one technique if you
want everyone to be able to see
your video (you need to combine
this HTML5 with Flash Video).
```

```
digi Tal righ Ts

```
At the time of writing, the
<video> element does not
support any type of Digital
Rights Management (DRM —
sometimes referred to as copy
protection). But a dedicated
pirate will usually find a way
around DRM.
```

```
FormaTs
```

```
Not all browsers support the
same video formats. Therefore,
you need to supply your video in
more than one format.
```

```
To reach as many browsers as
possible, you should provide the
video in the following formats:
```

```
H264: IE and Safari
WebM: Android, Chrome,
Firefox, Opera
```

```
Chrome, Firefox, and Opera have
indicated that they will support
a format called WebM. (Some
Flash players also support H264,
and WebM - which will save on
the number of conversions).
```

```
conTrols
```

```
The browser supplies its own
controls for the player, and
these can vary from browser
to browser. You can control the
appearance of these controls
using JavaScript (but that is
beyond the scope of this book).
```

```
in T he browser
```

```
One of the problems with players
such as the Flash Player is that
they can behave inconsistently
when elements such as menus
drop over them, or the window is
scaled up or down. The HTML5
option solves these issues.
```

```
Despite the HTML5 <video> element being a
very recent addition, it is enjoying widespread
use. Here are some of the key issues to be
aware of:

T o Your Pages

In HTML5 you do not need to
supply values for all attributes,
such as the controls, autoplay,
and loop attributes used
with the **<video>** element.
These attributes are like on/
off switches. If the attribute is
present, it turns that option on.
If the attribute is omitted, the
option is turned off.

If the browser does not
support the **<video>** element
or the format of video used,
it will display whatever is
between the opening **<video>**
and closing **</video>** tags.

```
preload
This attribute tells the browser
what to do when the page
loads. It can have one of three
values:
```

```
none
The browser should not load
the video until the user presses
play.
```

```
auto
The browser should download
the video when the page loads.
```

The browser should just collect
information such as the size,
first frame, track list, and
duration.

To specify the location of the file

You can also use multiple

You may choose to offer HTML5

Because some of the video
players built in Flash support
H264 encoding, if you use a

you would only need to provide
the video in H264 and WebM
formats. (You would not need
it in FLV format as well.) You
will see this demonstrated in
the example at the end of the

If you start to work with HTML5
video in depth, you can also:
```

● (^) Create your own playback

● (^) Provide different versions
of the video for browsers
that have different sized

lower resolution content for
handheld devices)
● (^) Tell different parts of a page
to change when the video

HTML5 has introduced a new

```
Some people ask how to get
music to play consistently even
when visitors move from one
page to another on a website.
```

```
This is actually quite difficult
to achieve and would rely on
techniques like using AJAX to
load page content or developing
the entire site in Flash.
```

```
This is why some sites offer
audio players in new windows,
so that listeners are not
interrupted when they move
between pages.
```

FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIOFLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO 218218

There are many MP3 players
that have already been written in
Flash, such as:
```

```
flash-mp3-player.net
musicplayer.sourceforge.net
http://www.wimpyplayer.com
```

```
Each of these players has
different functionality, so check
their features before choosing
one for your site.
```

```
This example uses a free player
from flash-mp3-player.net
which is embedded in the page
using the SWFObject technique
we met on pages 208-208. The
player is told the path to the MP3
file using a parameter called mp3.
```

```
After the second <script> tag,
you can see that we have created
two JavaScript variables; the first
called flashvars , the second
called params. Even though we
are not using the flashvars
variable, the SWFObject script
expects it before the params
variable so we need it there.
```

```
var flashvars = {};
var params = {
mp3: "music/noise.mp3"};
```

```
These variables are then added
at the end of the line that
embeds the MP3 player in the
page (just before the second
closing <script> tag).

HTML5 introduced the <audio>
element to include audio files
in your pages. As with HTML5
video, browsers expect different
formats for the audio.
```

```
The <audio> element has a
number of attributes which allow
you to control audio playback:
```

```
src
This attribute specifies the path
to the audio file.
```

```
controls
This attribute indicates whether
the player should display
controls. If you do not use this
attribute, no controls will be
shown by default. You can also
specify your own controls using
JavaScript.
```

```
autoplay
The presence of this attribute
indicates that the audio should
start playing automatically. (It is
considered better practice to let
visitors choose to play audio.)
```

preload
This attribute indicates what the
browser should do if the player is
not set to autoplay. It can have
the same values we saw on page
214 for the <video> element.
```

```
loop
This attribute specifies that the
audio track should play again
once it has finished.
```

```
This example only works in
browsers that support the Ogg
Vorbis audio format (Firefox,
Chrome, and Opera). For it to
work in Safari 5 and IE 9, the
audio would need to be in MP3
format (or use the <source>
element covered on the next
page to offer different formats).

```
It is possible to specify more
than one audio file using the
<source> element between the
opening <audio> and closing
</audio> tags (instead of the
src attribute on the opening
<audio> tag).
```

```
This is important because
different browsers support
different formats for audio files.
```

```
MP3: Safari 5+, Chrome 6+, IE9
```

```
Ogg Vorbis: Firefox 3.6, Chome
6, Opera 1.5, IE9
```

```
So you would need to supply two
audio formats to get coverage
across all recent browsers that
support the <audio> element.
You could also provide a Flash
alternative for older browsers
that do not support the <audio>
element.
```

```
The HTML5 <audio> tag has
not gained as widespread
adoption as the <video> tag,
and there have been some issues
with audio quality in the first
browsers to implement it.

Flash, Video & audio

X (^) Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to
the web.
X (^) Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.
X (^) HTML5 introduces new **<video>** and **<audio>**
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but
these are only supported in the latest browsers.
X (^) Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not
all support the same video and audio formats, so you
need to supply your files in different formats to ensure
that everyone can see/hear them.

227 INTRODUCING CSS

```
In this section, we will look at how to
make your web pages more attractive,
controlling the design of them using CSS.
```

```
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
```

```
Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS
mostly involves learning the different properties you can use.
So this chapter will:
```

● (^) Introduce you to how CSS works
● (^) Teach you how to write CSS rules
● (^) Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages
The remaining chapters in this section will look at all of the
various CSS properties you can use.

INTRODUCING CSS 228

229 INTRODUCING CSS

```
You may remember from
pages 185-186 that in there is a
difference between block level
and inline elements and how
how browsers display them.
```

```
Block level elements look
like they start on a new line.
Examples include the <h1> -
<h6> , <p> and <div> elements.
```

```
Inline elements flow within the
text and do not start on a new
line. Examples include <b> , <i> ,
<img> , <em> and <span>.
```

```
The key to understanding how CSS works is to
imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element.
```

underStandIng cSS:

thI nk Ing InSI de the Box

```
On this page, you can see a basic
HTML page.
```

```
On the right hand page, you can
see the same HTML page, but I
have added outlines to each of
the elements so that you can see
how CSS will treat each element
as if it lives inside its own box.
```

BL ock & InLI ne eLeMent S

```
INTRODUCING CSS 230
```

```
CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
```

```
In this example, block level
elements are shown with red
borders, and inline elements
have green borders.
```

```
The <body> element creates the
first box, then the <h1> , <h2> ,
<p> , <i> , and <a> elements each
create their own boxes within it.
```

```
Using CSS, you could add a
border around any of the boxes,
specify its width and height, or
add a background color. You
could also control text inside
a box — for example, its color,
size, and the typeface used.
```

Width and height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images

There are also specific ways
in which you can style certain
elements such as lists, tables,
and forms.

This rule indicates that all <p>

```

```
Selectors indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.
```

```
Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.
```

```
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

This rule indicates that all **<h1>** ,
**<h2>** and **<h3>** elements
should be shown in the Arial
typeface, in a yellow color.

```
Properties indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. For example, color, font,
width, height and border.
```

```
Values specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties. For example, if you
want to specify a color property
then the value is the color you
want the text in these elements
to be.
```

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two

parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify

several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

Here you can see a simple web page that is

styled using CSS.

This example uses two documents: the HTML file ( **example.html** )
and a separate CSS file ( **example.css** ). The fifth line of HTML uses the
**<link>** element to indicate where the CSS file is located.

On the next page, you will see how CSS rules can also be placed in your
HTML pages and we will discuss when you might want to do this.

**<link> chapter-10/using-external-css.html HtMl**

```
The <link> element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does
not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the <head> element.
It should use three attributes:
```

```
href
This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).
```

```
type
This attribute specifies the type
of document being linked to. The
value should be text/css.
```

```
rel
This specifies the relationship
between the HTML page and
the file it is linked to. The value
should be stylesheet when
linking to a CSS file.
```

```
An HTML page can use more
than one CSS style sheet. To
do this it could have a <link>
element for every CSS file it
uses. For example, some authors
use one CSS file to control the
presentation (such as fonts and
colors) and a second to control
the layout.

```
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.
```

```
The <style> element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.
```

```
When building a site with more
than one page, you should use
an external CSS style sheet. This:
```

● (^) Allows all pages to use the
same style rules (rather than
repeating them in each page).
● (^) Keeps the content separate
from how the page looks.
● (^) Means you can change the
styles used across all pages
by altering just one file
(rather than each individual
page).
uSI ng InternaL c SS
In HTML 4 and Transitional
XHTML, you could also use
a **style** attribute on most of
the elements that appear in the
body of a page. The CSS rules
that appeared within the value
of the attribute would only apply
to that one element. You should
avoid using this attribute in any
new site but I mention it here
because you may see it used in
older code. Here is an example
that changes the color of the text
in a single paragraph red:
\*\*<p style="color:red;">

- Css\*\*

237 INTRODUCING CSS

```
There are many different types
of CSS selector that allow you to
target rules to specific elements
in an HTML document.
```

```
The table on the opposite page
introduces the most commonly
used CSS selectors.
```

```
On this page, there is an HTML
file to demonstrate which
elements these CSS selectors
would apply to.
```

```
CSS selectors are case sensitive,
so they must match element
names and attribute values
exactly.
```

```
There are some more advanced
selectors which allow you
to select elements based on
attributes and their values,
which you will see on page 292.
```

```
IE 7 was the first version of IE to
support the last two selectors in
the table (the sibling selectors),
so their use is less common than
the other selectors shown here.

If there are two or more rules

LaSt ruLe
If the two selectors are identical,
the latter of the two will take
precedence. Here you can see
the second i selector takes
precedence over the first.
```

```
SpecIfIcI ty
If one selector is more specific
than the others, the more
specific rule will take precedence
over more general ones. In this
example:
```

```
h1 is more specific than *

p#intro is more specific than p
```

```
IM portant
You can add !important after
any property value to indicate
that it should be considered
more important than other rules
that apply to the same element.

Understanding how CSS rules
cascade means you can write
simpler style sheets because
you can create generic rules
that apply to most elements and
then override the properties on
individual elements that need to
appear differently.

HtMl chapter-10/inheritance.html
```

```
If you specify the font-family
or color properties on the
<body> element, they will apply
to most child elements. This is
because the value of the
font-family property is
inherited by child elements. It
saves you from having to apply
these properties to as many
elements (and results in simpler
style sheets).
```

```
You can compare this with
the background-color or
border properties; they are not
inherited by child elements. If
these were inherited by all child
elements then the page could
look quite messy.
```

```
You can force a lot of properties
to inherit values from their
parent elements by using
inherit for the value of the
properties. In this example, the
<div> element with a class
called page inherits the padding
size from the CSS rule that
applies to the <body> element.
```

InherItance

```
body {
font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
color: #665544;
padding: 10px;}
.page {
border: 1px solid #665544;
background-color: #efefef;
padding: inherit;}
```

```
Css
```

241 INTRODUCING CSS

```
All of your web pages can share
the same style sheet. This is
achieved by using the <link>
element on each HTML page of
your site to link to the same CSS
document. This means that the
same code does not need to be
repeated in every page (which
results in less code and smaller
HTML pages).
```

```
Therefore, once the user has
downloaded the CSS stylesheet,
the rest of the site will load
faster. If you want to make a
change to how your site appears,
you only need to edit the one
CSS file and all of your pages
will be updated. For example,
you can change the style of
every <h1> element by altering
```

```
the one CSS style sheet, rather
than changing the CSS rules on
every page. The HTML code
will be easier to read and edit
because it does not have lots of
CSS rules in the same document.
It is generally considered good
practice to have the content of
the site separated from the rules
that determine how it appears.
```

```
When building a website there are several advantages to placing your
CSS rules in a separate style sheet.
```

why uSe e xternaL

Sty Le SheetS?

```
If you are just creating a single
page, you might decide to put
the rules in the same file to
keep everything in one place.
(However, many authors would
consider it better practice to
keep the CSS in a separate file.)
```

```
If you have one page which
requires a few extra rules (that
are not used by the rest of the
site), you might consider using
CSS in the same page. (Again,
most authors consider it better
practice to keep all CSS rules in a
separate file.)
```

```
Most of the examples in this
book place the CSS rules in the
<head> of the document (using
the <style> element) rather
than a separate document. This
is simply to save you opening
two files to see how the CSS
examples work.
```

```
Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as
your HTML code.
```

```
INTRODUCING CSS 242
```

In the same way that there have
been several versions of HTML,
there have also been different
versions of CSS.

```
Browsers did not implement all
CSS features at once, so some
older browsers do not support
every property.
```

```
This is mentioned when it is
likely to affect you, along with
notes where CSS properties
might not behave as expected.
```

Before launching any new site,
it is important to test it in more
than one browser, because there
can be slight differences in how
browsers display the pages.

You do not need lots of
computers to test your site, as
there are online tools to show
you what a page looks like in
multiple browsers:

**BrowserCam.com
BrowserLab.Adobe.com
BrowserShots.org
CrossBrowserTesting.com**

```
Using these tools, it is a good
idea to check the site on
different operating systems (PC,
Mac, and Linux) and in older
versions of the major browsers,
as well as recent versions.
```

```
When you look at your site in
more than one browser, you
might find that some elements
on your page do not look as you
expect them to.
```

```
When a CSS property does
not display as expected, it
is generally referred to as a
browser quirk or Css bug.
```

```
Some common browser bugs are
discussed in this book, but there
are many smaller bugs that only
occur in rare situations, or on old
browsers that few people use.
```

```
If you come across a CSS bug,
you can use your favorite search
engine to try and find a solution.
Or you can check these sites:
```

```
PositionIsEverything.net
QuirksMode.org
```

CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on

CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to

implement it.

Any seasoned user of CSS will tell you that some browsers display a few

of the CSS properties in an unexpected way. But finding and squashing

those bugs is easy when you know how...

X (^) CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
X (^) Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
X (^) Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
X (^) Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
X (^) CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

In this chapter we will look at:
```

● (^) How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in
which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra
ways made available in CSS3)
● (^) Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors
● (^) Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable
● (^) Background colors for behind either your entire page or
parts of a page
What you will learn about colors in this chapter will then be
used in subsequent chapters when it comes to looking at
colors of text and boxes in CSS.

```

```
chapter-11/foreground-color.html Css
```

```
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
```

```
rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
```

```
hex Codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
```

```
Color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
```

```
We look at these three different
ways of specifying colors on the
next double-page spread.

```
CSS3 has also introduced
another way to specify colors
called HSLA, which you will
meet near the end of this chapter
on page 255-256.

Above each CSS rule in this
example you can see how CSS
allows you to add comments
to your CSS files. Anything
between the /* symbols and
the */ symbols will not be
interpreted by the browser.
They are shown in grey above.
```

```
The use of comments can help
you to understand a CSS file
(and organise it, by splitting a
long document into sections).
Here, we have used comments
to indicate which method is used
to specify each of the different
types of colors.

CSS treats each HTML element

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).
```

```
If you do not specify a
background color, then the
background is transparent.
```

By default, most browser
windows have a white

```
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
```

understanding Color

```
Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).
```

```
When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture.
```

```
The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue —
just like on a television screen.
```

```
Color picking tools are available
in image editing programs like
Photoshop and GIMP. You can
see the RGB values specified
next to the radio buttons that
say R, G, B.
```

```
The hex value is provided
next to the pound or hash
# symbol. There is also a
good color picking tool at:
colorschemedesigner.com
```

```
COLOR 252
```

RGB Values

Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255.

**rgb(102,205,170)**

This color is made up of the
following values:
102 red
205 green
170 blue

Hex Codes

```
Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.
```

```
#66cdaa
```

```
The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal
code. The 205 of the green is
expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa.
```

ColoR Names

```
Colors are represented by
predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.
```

```
MediumAquaMarine
```

```
There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this
color is MediumAquaMarine ).
Most consider this to be a
limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from
white and black) they are not
commonly used.
```

Hue

Hue is near to the colloquial idea
of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have
saturation and brightness as
well as hue.

satu RatioN

```
Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum
saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.
```

BRiGHtNess

```
Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there
would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the
color would be very dark.
```

253 COLOR

Contrast

```
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
```

```
Text is easier to read when
there is higher contrast between
background and foreground
colors.
```

```
If you want people to read a lot
of text on your page, however,
then too much contrast can
make it harder to read, too.
```

Contrast

```
If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you
can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font
to make it easier to read.
```

```
For long spans of text, reducing
the contrast a little bit improves
readability.
```

```
You can reduce contrast by
using dark gray text on a white
background or an off-white text
on a dark background.
```

```
Text is harder to read when
there is low contrast between
background and foreground
colors.
```

```
A lack of contrast is particularly
a problem for those with
visual impairments and color
blindness.
```

```
It also affects those with poor
monitors and sunlight on their
screens (which is increasingly
common as people use handheld
devices outdoors).
```

```

```
Css chapter-11/opacity.html
```

```
CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).
```

```
The CSS3 rgba property allows
you to specify a color, just like
you would with an RGB value,
but adds a fourth value to
indicate opacity. This value is
known as an alpha value and is
a number between 0.0 and 1.0
(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The
rgba value will only affect the
element on which it is applied
(not child elements).
```

```
Because some browsers will
not recognize RGBA colors, you
can offer a fallback so that they
display a solid color. If there are
two rules that apply to the same
element, the latter of the two
will take priority. To create the
fallback, you can specify a color
as a hex code, color name or
RGB value, followed by the rule
that specifies an RGBA value. If
the browser understands RGBA
colors it will use that rule. If it
doesn't, it will use the RGB value.
```

```
At the time of writing, the
opacity and rgba properties
are only supported by the most
recent browsers.

Hue

```
Hue is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.
```

satuRatioN

```
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.
```

li GHtNess

```
Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.
```

```
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.
```

Css3: hsl Colors

```
Please note that lightness is a
different concept to brightness.
Graphic design software (such
as Photoshop and GIMP) have
color pickers that use hue,
saturation, and brightness —
but brightness only adds black,
whereas lightness offers both
white and black.

```

```
Css chapter-11/hsla.html
```

```
The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts
with the letters hsl , followed
by individual values inside
parentheses for:
```

```
hue
This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
```

```
saturation
This is expressed as a
percentage.
```

```
lightness
This is expressed as a
percentage with 0% being white,
50% being normal, and 100%
being black.
```

```
The hsla color property allows
you to specify color properties
using hue, saturation, and
lightness as above, and adds a
fourth value which represents
transparency (just like the rgba
property). The a stands for:
```

```
alpha
This is expressed as a
number between 0 and 1.0.
For example, 0.5 represents
50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency.
```

Css3: hsl & hsla

**h sl, h sla**

```
Because older browsers do not
recognize HSL and HSLA values,
it is a good idea to add an extra
rule which specifies the color
using a hex code, RGB value, or
color name. This should appear
before the rule that uses the HSL
or HSLA value.
```

```
This provides a fallback because
if there are two rules that apply
to the same element in CSS, the
latter of the two always takes
priority. This means that if the
browser understands HSL and
HSLA colors, it will use that rule;
and if it does not, it will use the
first rule.
```

257 COLOR

example

Color

```
COLOR 258
```

The rule for the **<body>** element sets a default color for all the text as
well as the default background color for the page. Both use color names.

The rule for the **<h1>** element sets the color of the heading using a hex
code. There are two values for the **background-color** property of the
**<h1>** element. The first provides a fallback color using a hex code and
the second is an HSLA value for browsers that support this method.

Each paragraph is then shown in a different color to represent the
varying levels of acidity or alkalinity, and these are specified using RGB
values.

The example also uses a property called **margin** to decrease the gap
between the paragraph boxes, and a property called **padding** to create
a gap between the edge of the boxes and the text within them. (These
properties are covered on pages 313-314.)

This example shows a pH scale to demonstrate

the different ways that colors can be specified

using CSS (using color names, hex codes, RGB,

and HSL).

The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
```

● (^) Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
● (^) Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)
The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are. As we look through these
properties I will also give you some design tips on how to
display your type.

Typeface Terminology

Serif

```
Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs.
```

```
In print, serif fonts were
traditionally used for long
passages of text because they
were considered easier to read.
```

SanS-Serif

```
Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.
```

```
Screens have a lower resolution
than print. So, if the text is small,
sans-serif fonts can be clearer
to read.
```

monoSpace

```
Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)
```

```
Monospace fonts are commonly
used for code because they align
nicely, making the text easier to
follow.

```
Italic fonts have a cursive aspect
to some of the lettering. Oblique
font styles take the normal style
and put it on an angle.
```

```
In condensed (or narrow)
versions of the font, letters are
thinner and closer together.
In expanded versions they are
thicker and further apart.

```
Many commercial makers of

although you may need to pay
for an extra web-use license.

The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:
```

```
pixelS
Pixels are commonly used
because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.
```

```
percenTage S
The default size of text in
browsers is 16px. So a size of
75% would be the equivalent of
12px, and 200% would be 32px.
```

```
If you create a rule to make all
text inside the <body> element
to be 75% of the default size (to
make it 12px), and then specify
another rule that indicates the
content of an element inside the
<body> element should be 75%
size, it will be 9px (75% of the
12px font size).
```

```
emS
An em is equivalent to the width
of a letter m.
```

```
We will look at these
measurements in greater detail
on the next page.

##### 72 pt

```
This is because they are set
according to a scale or ratio that
was developed by European
typographers in the sixteenth
century.
```

```
It is considered that this scale
for type is pleasing to the eye
and it has therefore changed
little in the last 400 years.
```

```
For this reason, when you are
designing pages, using sizes
from this scale will help them
look more attractive.
```

```
On the next page, you can see
how to achieve this scale using
pixels, percentages, and ems.
```

```
Print designers often refer to the
size of text in terms of points
rather than pixels (hence the
use of pt in the scale on the
right). A pixel roughly equates
to a point because a point
corresponds to 1/72 of an inch,
and most computer displays
have a resolution of 72 dots per
inch.
```

```
The default size of text in a
browser is 16 pixels. So if you
use percentages or ems, you
calculate the size of text you
want based on the default size
of the text used in browsers.
For example, you could scale
down to 12 pixels for body copy
and scale up to 24 pixels for
headings.
```

```
Recently, some web designers
have started to leave the body
text at the default size of 16
pixels and adjust the other font
sizes using a scale that keeps
the relative proportions of this
one.
```

```
When you first see body text at
16 pixels, it might seem quite
large. Once you get used to
the larger type, however, most
people find it far easier to read;
and going back to a page where
main type is 12 pixels will often
then look quite small.

uniTS of Type Size

Setting font size in pixels is the
best way to ensure that the type
appears at the size you intended
(because percentages and ems
are more likely to vary if a user
has changed the default size of
text in their browser).

Pixels are relative to the
resolution of the screen, so the
same type size will look larger
when a screen has a resolution
of 800x600 than it would when
it is 1280x800.

You can also use **pt** for point
sizes instead of **px** for pixels, but
you should only do this when
creating style sheets for printer-
friendly versions of pages.

```
The default size of text in a
web browser is 16 pixels. Using
percentages of this amount, you
can create a scale where the
default text size is 12 pixels, and
headings are sized in relation
to this.
```

```
It is possible for users to change
the default size of text in their
web browsers. If they have
done this, the fonts will be
displayed at the same scale that
the designer intended, but at a
larger size.
```

```
Ems allow you to change the size
of text relative to the size of the
text in the parent element. Since
the default size of text in web
browsers is 16 pixels, you can
use similar rules to those shown
for percentages.
```

```
Because users can change
the default size of text in their
browser, the fonts could all
appear larger (or smaller) than
the designer intended.
```

```
The extra p rule above is to help
Internet Explorer 6 and 7 display
the fonts at the right size.
Without this extra rule, IE6 and
IE7 exaggerate the relative sizes
of other text.

@font-face allows you to use
a font, even if it is not installed
on the computer of the person
browsing, by allowing you to
specify a path to a copy of the
font, which will be downloaded if
it is not on the user's machine.
```

```
Because this technique allows
a version of the font to be
downloaded to the user's
computer, it is important that the
license for the font permits it to
be used in this way.
```

```
You add the font to your style
sheet using the @font-face
rule, as shown on the right.
```

```
font-family
This specifies the name of the
font. This name can then be used
as a value of the font-family
property in the rest of the style
sheet (as shown in the rule for
the <h1> and <h2> elements).
```

```
src
This specifies the path to the
font. In order for this technique
to work in all browsers, you will
probably need to specify paths
to a few different versions of the
font, as shown on the next page.
```

```
format
This specifies the format that the
font is supplied in. (It's discussed
in detail on the next page.)
```

Many typeface makers do not
allow you to use their fonts in
this way, but there are open
source fonts you can use freely.
You can find lists of them at:
```

```
http://www.fontsquirrel.com
http://www.fontex.org
http://www.openfontlibrary.org
```

```
When looking at fonts on these
sites, it is still important to check
the font's license agreement
because some fonts are only free
for personal use (that is, not for
use on commercial websites).
```

```
There are some sites that give
you access to use commercial
fonts, because they negotiated
permission to let their customers
use these fonts for a fee:
```

```
http://www.typekit.com
http://www.kernest.com
http://www.fontspring.com
```

```
Google also provides open
source fonts. Rather than adding
the @font-face rule to your own
style sheet, you link to a CSS file
and font files on their servers:

**css chapter-12/understanding-font-formats.html**

Different browsers support
different formats for fonts
(in the same way that they
support different audio and
video formats), so you will need
to supply the font in several
variations to reach all browsers.
```

```
If you do not have all of these
formats for your font, you can
upload the font to a website
called FontSquirrel where they
will convert it for you:
```

```
http://www.fontsquirrel.com/
fontface/generator
```

```
Font Squirrel also provides you
with the CSS code for the
@font-face rule. This is very
helpful because, when you
are dealing with multiple font
formats, the src and format
properties of the @font-face
rule can get rather complicated.
```

```
You can see an example of a
more complicated @font-face
rule on the left.
```

The various font formats should
appear in your code in this order:

```

```
chapter-12/font-weight.html css
```

```
The font-weight property
allows you to create bold text.
There are two values that this
property commonly takes:
```

```
normal
This causes text to appear at a
normal weight.
```

```
bold
This causes text to appear bold.
```

```
In this example, you can see
that the element whose class
attribute has a value of credits
has been bolded.
```

```
You might wonder why there is
a normal weight. This is because
if, for example, you created a
rule for the <body> element
indicating that all text inside the
body should appear bold, you
might need an option that allows
the text in certain instances
to appear normal weight. So
it is essentially used as an "off
switch."
```

If you want to create italic text,
you can use the font-style
property. There are three values
this property can take:
```

```
normal
This causes text to appear in a
normal style (as opposed to italic
or oblique).
```

```
italic
This causes text to appear italic.
```

```
oblique
This causes text to appear
oblique.
```

```
In this example, you can see that
the credits have been italicized.
```

```
Italic fonts were traditionally
stylized versions of the font
based on calligraphy, whereas an
oblique version would take the
normal version and put it on an
angle.
```

```
It is not unusual for the browser
to fail to find an italic version of a
typeface, in which case it will use
an algorithm to place the normal
version of the type on a slant,
which means that a lot of italic
text online is actually oblique.

chapter-12/text-transform.html css
```

```
The text-transform property
is used to change the case of
text giving it one of the following
values:
```

```
uppercase
This causes the text to appear
uppercase.
```

```
lowercase
This causes the text to appear
lowercase.
```

```
capitalize
This causes the first letter of
each word to appear capitalized.
```

```
In this example, the <h1>
element is uppercase, the <h2>
element is lowercase, and the
credits are capitalized. In the
HTML, the word by in the credits
had a lowercase b.
```

```
If you do utilize the uppercase
option, it is worth looking at
the letter-spacing property
to increase the gap between
each letter as shown on page

Leading (pronounced ledding ) is
a term typographers use for the
vertical space between lines of
text. In a typeface, the part of
a letter that drops beneath the
baseline is called a descender ,
while the highest point of a letter
is called the ascender. Leading
is measured from the bottom of
the descender on one line to the
top of the ascender on the next.
```

```

```
In CSS, the line-height
property sets the height of
an entire line of text, so the
difference between the font-
size and the line-height is
equivalent to the leading (as
shown in the diagram above).
```

```
Increasing the line-height
makes the vertical gap between
lines of text larger.

Kerning is the term
typographers use for the space
between each letter. You can
control the space between each
letter with the letter-spacing
property.
```

```
It is particularly helpful to
increase the kerning when
your heading or sentence is
all in uppercase. If your text is
in sentence (or normal) case,
increasing or decreasing the
kerning can make it harder to
read.
```

```
You can also control the gap
between words using the
word-spacing property.
```

```
When you specify a value for
these properties, it should
be given in ems, and it will be
added on top of the default value
specified by the font.
```

```
The default gap between
words is set by the typeface
(often around 0.25em), and
it is unlikely that you would
need to change this property
regularly. If the typeface is bold
or you have increased the space
between letters, then a larger
gap between words can increase
readability.

```
The text-align property allows
you to control the alignment of
text. The property can take one
of four values:
```

```
left
This indicates that the text
should be left-aligned.
```

```
right
This indicates that the text
should be right-aligned.
```

```
center
This allows you to center text.
```

```
justify
This indicates that every line in
a paragraph, except the last line,
should be set to take up the full
width of the containing box.
```

```
When you have several
paragraphs of text, it is
considered easiest to read if the
text is left-aligned.
```

```
Justified text looks at the words
on each individual line and
creates an equal gap between
those words. It can look odd
if you end up with large gaps
between some words and
smaller gaps between others.
This often happens when your
lines are not very wide or when
your text contains long words.

The vertical-align property is
a common source of confusion.
It is not intended to allow you to
vertically align text in the middle
of block level elements such as
<p> and <div> , although it does
have this effect when used with
table cells (the <td> and <th>
elements).
```

```
It is more commonly used with
inline elements such as <img> ,
<em> , or <strong> elements.
When used with these elements,
it performs a task very similar to
the HTML align attribute used
on the <img> element, which
you met on pages 103-106. The
values it can take are:
```

```
baseline

It can also take a length (usually
specified in pixels or ems) or a
percentage of the line height.

The text-indent property
allows you to indent the first
line of text within an element.
The amount you want the line
indented by can be specified in
a number of ways but is usually
given in pixels or ems.
```

```
It can take a negative value,
which means it can be used
to push text off the browser
window. You can see this
technique used in this example,
where the <h1> element uses a
background image to represent
the heading. The text has been
moved far to the left, off the
screen. (Background images are
covered on pages 413-418.)
```

```
We still want the heading text
to be on the page (for search
engines and those who cannot
see the image), but we cannot
have it displayed on top of the
logo or it will be unreadable. By
pushing it 9,999 pixels to the
left, it is way out of sight but still
in the HTML code.
```

```
The second rule in this example
indents the credits 20 pixels to
the right.

The text-shadow property has
become commonly used despite
lacking support in all browsers.
```

```
It is used to create a drop
shadow, which is a dark version
of the word just behind it and
slightly offset. It can also be used
to create an embossed effect by
adding a shadow that is slightly
lighter than the text.
```

```
The value of this property is
quite complicated because it can
take three lengths and a color for
the drop shadow.
```

```
The first length indicates how
far to the left or right the shadow
should fall.
```

```
The second value indicates the
distance to the top or bottom
that the shadow should fall.
```

```
The third value is optional and
specifies the amount of blur that
should be applied to the drop
shadow.
```

```
The fourth value is the color of
the drop shadow.
```

```
The text-shadow property
has become very popular but
at the time of writing it was
not supported in any versions
of Internet Explorer (currently
IE9). Other browser makers
introduced it in Firefox 3.1, Safari

It is worth trying this example in

CSS introduces both pseudo-

A pseudo-element acts like an
extra element is in the code. In
the case of the :first-letter

elements, it is as if there is an
extra element around the first

have its own styles applied.
```

```
A pseudo-class acts like an
extra value for a class attribute.
In the case of the :visited
pseudo-class, which you meet

to have different styles for links

the :hover pseudo-class allows
you to style elements differently

There are three pseudo-classes
that allow you to change the
appearance of elements when a
user is interacting with them.
```

```
:hover
This is applied when a user
hovers over an element with a
pointing device such as a mouse.
This has commonly been used
to change the appearance of
links and buttons when a user
places their cursor over them. It
is worth noting that such events
do not work on devices that use
touch screens (such as the iPad)
because the screen is not able to
tell when someone is hovering
their finger over an element.
```

```
:active
This is applied when an element
is being activated by a user; for
example, when a button is being
pressed or a link being clicked.
Sometimes this is used to make
a button or link feel more like it
is being pressed by changing the
style or position of the element
slightly.
```

```
:focus
This is applied when an element
has focus. Any element that
you can interact with, such as a
link you can click on or any form
control can have focus.
```

293 TEXT

example

Tex T

```
TEXT 294
```

This example combines many of the techniques

shown in this chapter.

The sizes of fonts are controlled using the **font-size** property. The
headings are changed from bold to normal using the **font-weight**
property. We have also specified different choices of font using the
**font-family** property.

The **<h1>** element uses the CSS3 **text-shadow** property to create the
drop shadow behind it. The **<h2>** element is converted to uppercase
using the **text-transform** property, and to make the uppercase text
easier to read, we have increased the space between each letter using
the **letter-spacing** property.

For the main body text, we have increased the **line-height** property so
there is a bigger gap between each line of text, thereby making it easier
to read. In the first paragraph, the **first-line** pseudo-element allows
us to style the first line of the introduction in bold. Finally, the credit is
italicized and aligned to the right-hand side of the page.

briard **</a>** , or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a
herder and guardian of sheep. **</p>
<h3>** Breed History **</h3>
<p>** The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense
of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of
extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering.
Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards. **</p>

301 BOXES

```
At the beginning of this section on CSS,
you saw how CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.
```

```
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
```

● (^) Control the dimensions of your boxes
● (^) Create borders around boxes
● (^) Set margins and padding for boxes
● (^) Show and hide boxes
Once you have learned how to control the appearance of each
box, you will see how to position these boxes on your pages in
Chapter 15 when we look at page layout.

```
By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
```

```
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
```

```
When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window
or, if the box is encased within
another box, it is a percentage of
the size of the containing box.
```

```
When you use ems, the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it. Designers
have recently started to use
percentages and ems more for
measurements as they try to
create designs that are flexible
across devices which have
different-sized screens.
```

```
In the example on the right, you
can see that a containing <div>
element is used which is 300
pixels wide by 300 pixels high.
Inside of this is a paragraph
that is 75% of the width and
height of the containing element.
This means that the size of the
paragraph is 225 pixels wide by
225 pixels high.
```

Some page designs expand and
shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.
```

```
These are very helpful properties
to ensure that the content of
pages are legible (especially on
the smaller screens of handheld
devices). For example, you can
use the max-width property to
ensure that lines of text do not
appear too wide within a big
browser window and you can
use the min-width property
to make sure that they do not
appear too narrow.
```

```
You may find it helpful to try this
example out in your browser so
that you can see what happens
when you increase or decrease
the size of the browser window.
```

```
Please note that these properties
were first supported in IE7 and
Firefox 2 so they will not work in
older versions of these browsers.

In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
```

```
The example on this page
demonstrates these properties
in action. It also shows you what
happens when the content of the
box takes up more space than
the size specified for the box.
```

```
If the box is not big enough to
hold the content, and the content
expands outside the box it can
look very messy. To control
what happens when there is not
enough space for the content of
a box, you can use the overflow
property, which is discussed on
the next page.

The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
```

```
hidden
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
```

```
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.
```

```
On the left, you can see two
boxes whose contents expand
beyond their set dimensions. The
first example has the overflow
property with a value of hidden.
The second example has the
overflow property with a value
of scroll.
```

```
The overflow property is
particularly handy because some
browsers allow users to adjust
the size of the text to appear as
large or as small as they want. If
the text is set too large then the
page can become an unreadable
mess. Hiding the overflow on
such boxes helps prevent items
overlapping on the page.

If you specify a width
for a box, then the
borders, margin, and
padding are added to
its width and height.
```

```
Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
```

Bor Der, mArgin

& PADD ing

###### 1

Border

```
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.
```

###### 2

Margin

```
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
```

###### 3

Padding

```
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.
```

### hello

```
BOXES 308
```

Designers refer to the space
between items on a page as
**white space**. Imagine you had
a border around a box. You
would not want the text to touch
this border or it would become
harder to read.

```
Or, imagine you had two boxes
sitting side by side (each with
a black border). You would not
necessarily want the boxes to
touch edges as this would make
the line look twice as thick on
the facing sides.
```

```
If the bottom margin of any
box touches the top margin of
another, the browser will render
it differently than you might
expect. It will only show the
larger of the two margins. If both
margins are the same size, it will
only show one.
```

```
The padding and
margin properties
are very helpful
in adding space
between various
items on the page.

The border-width property
is used to control the width
of a border. The value of this
property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the
following values:
```

```
thin
medium
thick
```

```
(You cannot use percentages
with this property.)
```

```
You can control the individual
size of borders using four
separate properties:
```

```
border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width
```

```
You can also specify different
widths for the four border values
in one property, like so:
```

```

The padding property allows
you to specify how much space
should appear between the
content of an element and its
border.
```

```
The value of this property is
most often specified in pixels
(although it is also possible to
use percentages or ems). If a
percentage is used, the padding
is a percentage of the browser
window (or of the containing box
if it is inside another box).
```

```
Please note: If a width is
specified for a box, padding is
added onto the width of the box.
```

```
As you can see, the second
paragraph here is much easier
to read because there is a space
between the text and the border
of the box. The box is also wider
because it has padding.
```

```
You can specify different values
for each side of a box using:
```

```
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

The margin property controls
the gap between boxes. Its value
is commonly given in pixels,
although you may also use
percentages or ems.
```

```
If one box sits on top of another,
margins are collapsed , which
means the larger of the two
margins will be used and the
smaller will be disregarded.
```

```
Please note: If the width of a box
is specified then the margin is
added to the width of the box.

```
You can specify values for each
side of a box using:
```

```
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom

You can also use the shorthand
(where the values are in
clockwise order: top, right,
bottom, left):
margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
```

```
Sometimes you might see the
following, which means that the
left and right margins should be

```
If you want to center a box on
the page (or center it inside
the element that it sits in), you
can set the left-margin and
right-margin to auto.
```

```
In order to center a box on the
page, you need to set a width
for the box (otherwise it will take
up the full width of the page).
```

```
Once you have specified the
width of the box, setting the left
and right margins to auto will
make the browser put an equal
gap on each side of the box. This
centers the box on the page (or
within the element that the box
sits inside).
```

```
In order for this to work in older
browsers (particularly IE6), the
element that the box sits inside
should have a text-align
property with its value set to
center.
```

```
The text-align property is
inherited by child elements. You
therefore also need to specify
the text-align property on the
centered box if you do not want
the text inside it to be centered.

When you specify the width of
a box, any padding or margin
should be added to the width of
it. Internet Explorer 6, however,
has a quirk whereby it includes
the padding and margins in the
width of the box.
```

```
The way around this is to ensure
that you provide a DOCTYPE
declaration for the HTML page.
(DOCTYPE declarations were
covered on page 181.) You can
use either the HTML5, HTML
4 strict, or HTML 4 transitional
DOCTYPE declarations to
ensure that IE6 follows the
correct box model.
```

```
To demonstrate this, you can
see the example from the left
hand page shown in IE6, first
without a DOCTYPE declaration
and then again with the HTML5
DOCTYPE declaration.

The display property allows
you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.

The values this property can
take are:
```

```

acts as though it is not on the
page at all (although a user could
still see the content of the box if
they used the view source option

```

```
This technique is often used to
create navigation for a site, and
in this example a margin has
been added to the right of each
of the items to separate them
out. The rule that applies to the
<li> element whose class is
coming-soon has been hidden
as if it were not in the page at all.

The visibility property allows
you to hide boxes from users
but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.
```

```
This property can take two
values:
```

```
hidden
This hides the element.
```

```
visible
This shows the element.
```

```
If the visibility of an element
is set to hidden , a blank space
will appear in its place.
```

```
If you do not want a blank space
to appear, then you should use
the display property with
a value of none instead (as
covered on the previous page).
```

```
Please note that anyone can view
the contents of any elements
whose visibility property has
been set to hidden by viewing
the source in their browser.
```

The border-image property
applies an image to the border of
any box. It takes a background
image and slices it into nine
pieces.
```

```
Here is the image. I have
added marks where it is
sliced in the example,
taking 18 pixels from each corner
to place an entire circle in each
corner. The corner slices are
always placed in the four corners
of the box, but we have a choice
whether the sides are stretched
or repeated.
```

```
This property requires three
pieces of information:
```

```
1: The URL of the image
2: Where to slice the image
3: What to do with the straight
edges; the possible values are:
stretch stretches the image
repeat repeats the image
round like repeat but if the
tiles do not fit exactly, scales
the tile image so they will
```

```
The box must also have a border
width for the image to be shown.
```

```
The -moz-border-image
and -webkit-border-image
properties are not in the CSS
specification but help earlier
versions of Chrome, Firefox, and
Safari display this effect.

The box-shadow property
allows you to add a drop shadow
around a box. It works just like
the text-shadow property that
you met on page 288. It must
use at least the first of these two
values as well as a color:
```

```
horizontAl offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the left of the box.
```

```
verticAl offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the top of the box.
```

```
Blur Dist Ance
If omitted, the shadow is a solid
line like a border.
```

```
sP re AD of shAD oW
If used, a positive value will
cause the shadow to expand in
all directions, and a negative
value will make it contract.
```

```
The inset keyword can also
be used before these values to
create an inner-shadow.
```

```
Chrome, Firefox, and Safari were
quick to support this property
using the -moz-box-shadow
and -webkit-box-shadow
properties. These are not in the
CSS specification but using them
can help this style to work in
these browsers.

CSS3 introduces the ability to
create rounded corners on any
box, using a property called
border-radius. The value
indicates the size of the radius
in pixels.
```

```
Older browsers that do not
support this property will show a
box with right-angled corners.
```

```
The -moz-border-radius
and -webkit-border-radius
properties are not in the CSS
specification. However, they
are used in some versions of
Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to
offer early support for this style
(and therefore can be used
to achieve this effect in more
browsers).
```

```
You can specify individual values
for each corner of a box using:
```

```
border-top-right-radius
border-bottom-right-radius
border-bottom-left-radius
border-top-left-radius
```

```
You can also use a shorthand
of these four properties (in
clockwise order: top, right,
bottom, left). For example:
```

```
border-radius: 5px, 10px,
5px, 10px;
```

```
BOXESBOXES 322322

```
To create more complex shapes,
you can specify different
distances for the horizontal and
the vertical parts of the rounded
corners.
```

```
For example, this will create a
radius that is wider than it is tall:
```

```
border-radius: 80px 50px;
```

```
You can target just one corner
using the individual properties
for that corner:
```

```
border-top-left-radius:
80px 50px;
```

```
There is also a shorthand for
targetting all four corners at
once; first you specify the four
horizontal values, then the four
vertical values, as shown in the
second shape on the left.
```

```
You can even create a circle by
taking a square box and making
the border-radius the same
height as the square, as shown in
the third shape on the left.
```

In this example, you can see a simple

homepage for a music shop.

The whole page sits inside a **<div>** element with an **id** of **page**. This is
centered using the **margin** property, with a value of **auto** for the left and
right margins. The logo and other content are centered using this same
technique.

The main **<div>** has a double-lined border around it, and the size of
this box will expand and contract if the browser window is resized. To
prevent the page from becoming too narrow or too wide, the **min-width**
and **max-width** properties are used.

The navigation is created using an unordered list. There are borders
set to the top and bottom of this list to make it stand out. The **display**
property has been applied to each of the items in the list so they behave
like inline (rather than block-level) elements. This enables the navigation
links to sit next to each other horizontally. The **padding** property has
been used to create space between each of the links.

The **width** property for the **<ul>** element is set to 570 pixels, and the
width property for the **<p>** elements beneath them is set to 600 pixels.
They actually end up the same width as each other because the **<ul>**
element also uses padding to create a gap between the border of the box
it creates and the links inside of it, and any padding, borders, or margins
are added to the width and height of the box.

If we had not included a **DOCTYPE** declaration at the start of this page,
the sizes of the boxes would be different to each other in Internet
Explorer 6 because this browser did not implement the box model in the
correct way.

There are several CSS properties that
were created to work with specific types
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,
and forms.
```

In this chapter you will learn how to:
```

● (^) Specify the type of bullet point or numbering on lists
● (^) Add borders and backgrounds to table cells
● (^) Control the appearance of form controls
Together, these properties allow you to take finer control over
specific parts of your pages.

```
Lists are indented into the page
by default and the list-style-
position property indicates
whether the marker should
appear on the inside or the
outside of the box containing the
main points.
```

```
This property can take one of
two values:
```

```
outside
The marker sits to the left of the
block of text. (This is the default
behaviour if this property is not
used.)
```

```
inside
The marker sits inside the box of
text (which is indented).
```

```
In the example shown, the width
of the list has been limited to 150
pixels. This ensures that the text
wraps onto a new line so you can
see how the value of inside sits
the bullet inside the first line of
text.
```

```
A margin has been added to
each list item so that there is a
clear gap between each.

properties that are commonly
used with tables. Here we will
put them together in a single
example using the following:
```

```
width to set the width of the
table
```

```
padding to set the space
between the border of each table
cell and its content
```

```
text-transform to convert the
content of the table headers to
uppercase
```

```
letter-spacing, font-size
to add additional styling to the
content of the table headers
```

```
border-top, border-bottom
to set borders above and below
the table headers
```

```
text-align to align the writing
to the left of some table cells and
to the right of the others
```

```
background-color to change
the background color of the

Here are some tips for styling
tables to ensure they are clean
and easy to follow:
```

```
give ceLL s P adding
If the text in a table cell either
touches a border (or another
cell), it becomes much harder to
read. Adding padding helps to
improve readability.
```

```
distingUish headings
Putting all table headings in
bold (the default style for the
<th> element) makes them
easier to read. You can also
make headings uppercase and
then either add a background
color or an underline to clearly
distinguish them from content.
```

```
shade aLternate rows
Shading every other row can
help users follow along the lines.
Use a subtle distinction from the
normal color of the rows to keep
the table looking clean.
```

```
aL ign nUmeraLs
You can use the text-align
property to align the content
of any column that contains
numbers to the right, so that
large numbers are clearly
distinguished from smaller ones.
```

```
onLine extra
There are more examples of
using CSS to style tables in the
tools section of the website.

chapter-14/empty-cells.html HtMl
```

```
If you have empty cells in
your table, then you can use
the empty-cells property to
specify whether or not their
borders should be shown.
```

```
Since browsers treat empty cells
in different ways, if you want to
explicitly show or hide borders
on any empty cells then you
should use this property.
```

```
It can take one of three values:
```

```
show
This shows the borders of any
empty cells.
```

```
hide
This hides the borders of any
empty cells.
```

```
inherit
If you have one table nested
inside another, the inherit
value instructs the table cells to
obey the rules of the containing
table.
```

```
In the first table on the left, you
can see that the border of the
empty cell is showing. In the
second table, it is hidden.
```

```
LISTS, TABLES AND FORMSLISTS, TABLES AND FORMS 340340
```

```
The border-spacing property
allows you to control the
distance between adjacent cells.
By default, browsers often leave
a small gap between each table
cell, so if you want to increase
or decrease this space then
the border-spacing property
allows you to control the gap.
```

```
The value of this property is
usually specified in pixels. You
can specify two values if desired
to specify separate numbers for
horizontal and vertical spacing.
```

```
When a border has been used
on table cells, where two cells
meet, the width of lines would be
twice that of the outside edges.
It is possible to collapse adjacent
borders to prevent this using the
border-collapse property.
Possible values are:
```

```
collapse
Borders are collapsed into a
single border where possible.
( border-spacing will be
ignored and cells pushed
together, and empty-cells
properties will be ignored.)
```

```
separate
Borders are detached from each
other. ( border-spacing and
empty-cells will be obeyed.)

sty Ling Forms

```
Nobody I know enjoys filling
in forms, so if you can make
yours look more attractive and
easier to use, more people are
likely to fill it in. Also, when you
come to look at a form in a few
different browsers (as shown
on the right), you will see that
each browser displays them
differently.
```

```
CSS is commonly used to
control the appearance of form
elements. This is both to make
them more attractive and to
make them more consistent
across different browsers
```

```
It is most common to style:
```

● (^) Text inputs and text areas
● (^) Submit buttons
● (^) Labels on forms, to get the
form controls to align nicely
In the coming pages you will see
how to control these with CSS.

Styling text inputs and submit
buttons is fairly easy. It is
harder to get select boxes, radio
buttons, and checkboxes to look
consistent across all browsers.
To achieve this, you might like to
download the CSS files available
at **[http://formalize.me.](http://formalize.me.)**
The author of this website has
done the hard work of making
forms look consistent across
browsers. Although the solution
incorporates JavaScript, no prior
knowledge of this is needed in
order to implement the code.

```
Css chapter-14/styling-text-inputs.html
```

```
This example demonstrates the
CSS properties commonly used
with text inputs, most of which
you have already met.
```

```
font-size sets the size of the
text entered by the user.
```

```
color sets the text color, and
background-color sets the
background color of the input.
```

```
border adds a border around
the edge of the input box, and
border-radius can be used
to create rounded corners (for
browsers that support this
p ro p e r t y).
```

```
The :focus pseudo-class is
used to change the background
color of the text input when it
is being used, and the :hover
psuedo-class applies the same
styles when the user hovers over
them.
```

```
background-image adds a
background image to the box.
Because there is a different
image for each input, we are
using an attribute selector
looking for the value of the id
attribute on each input.
```

```
You will learn more about
background images and how to
position them in Chapter 16.

chapter-14/styling-submit-buttons.html Css
```

```
Here are some properties that
can be used to style submit
buttons. This example builds
on the one in the previous page,
and the submit button inherits
the styles set for the <input>
element on the last page.
```

```
color is used to change the
color of the text on the button.
```

```
text-shadow can give a 3D
look to the text in browsers that
support this property.
```

```
border-bottom has been used
to make the bottom border of
the button slightly thicker, which
gives it a more 3D feel.
```

```
background-color can make
the submit button stand out
from other items around it.
(Creating a consistent style
for all buttons helps users
understand how they should
interact with the site.) A gradient
background has been added for
browsers that support gradients.
Gradients are covered on
page 419.
```

```
The :hover pseudo-class
has been used to change the
appearance of the button when
the user hovers over it. In this
case, the background changes,
the text gets darker, and the
thicker border is applied to the
top of the button.

Fieldsets are particularly helpful
in determining the edges of a
form. In a long form they can
help group together related
information within it.
```

```
The legend is used to indicate
what information is required in
the fieldset.
```

```
Properties commonly used with
these two elements include:
```

```
width is used to control
the width of the fieldset. In
this example, the width of
the fieldset forces the form
elements to wrap onto a new line
in the correct place. (If it were
wider, the items might sit on one
line.)
```

color is used to control the
color of text.

```
background-color is used to
change the color behind these
items.

border is used to control the
appearance of the border around
the fieldset and/or legend.

chapter-14/aligning-form-controls-problem.html HtMl
```

```
Labels for form elements are
often different lengths, which
means that the form controls will
not appear in a straight line. This
is demonstrated in the example
on the right (without CSS applied
to the form controls).
```

```
In this form, each topic we ask
the user about is placed inside
a <div> element to ensure that
each question appears on a new
line. It is easier for users to fill in
a form if the form controls are
aligned in a straight vertical line.
The CSS on the opposite page
addresses this.
```

```
If you look at where we ask
users their gender, the two
radio buttons each have their
own <label> (one saying male
and another saying female). A
<span> element has been added
to the title which will help align
these controls.
```

```
On the previous page we saw
another technique to align form
elements. When the form only
contains text inputs, by setting
all of the text inputs to be the
same width, as well as aligning
all of the form content to the
right, the fields line up and the
labels are in a consistent place.
For more complex forms, you
will need a solution more like the
one shown on these pages.

```
Each row of the form has a title
telling users what they need to
enter. For the text inputs, the
title is in the <label> element.
For the radio buttons, the title is
in a <span> element. Both have
a class attribute with a value of
title.
```

```
We can use a property called
float to move the titles to the
left of the page. (The float
property is covered in greater
detail on pages 370-376.)
```

```
By setting the width property
on those elements, we know that
the titles will each take up the
same width. Therefore, the form
controls next to them will line up.
```

```
The text-align property is
used to align the titles to the
right, and padding is used
to make sure there is a gap
between the text in the title
boxes and the form controls.
```

```
Styles are also applied to the
<div> elements that contain
each row of the form (fixing
their width and creating vertical
space between each row). The
submit button is also aligned to
the right.
```

For example, on a form you

they are not used to seeing it.)

While you are hovering over
an element, the structure will
be shown at the top of the
window. Here you can see the
<li> element has a class of

a class called to-do. The list
is inside a <div> element with
an id of page , and this sits
inside the <body> and <html>

For the list of free poetry events near the start of the page, the bullet
points are styled with an image. The space between each list item is
increased using the **line-height** property.

For the table, the gaps between cells are removed using the **border-
spacing** property. Font size is set for the **<td>** and **<th>** elements as
they do not inherit their size from parent elements.

The head of the table has a darker background, light text, and a dark
2-pixel line between it and the table content. Rounded corners on the
table header are created using the **:first-child** and **:last-child**
pseudo classes (for browsers that support rounded corners).

Alternate rows of the table have different shading, and texture is added
with different borders on each side of the cell.

For the form, the related form controls are put in a **<fieldset>** element.
The labels of the form controls on the left also use the **float** property to
ensure the form controls are vertically aligned.

When the text boxes of the form receive focus, or the user hovers over it,
the background color and border colors change. The submit button has
also been styled to make it clear where people should submit the form.

This example demonstrates several of the

CSS properties we have met in this chapter to

control the presentation of lists, tables, and

forms.

Building Blocks

```
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
```

```
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
```

```
Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
```

```
inline elements

containing ElEmEnts

If one block-level element sits inside another

block-level element then the outer box is

known as the **containing** or **parent** element.

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a **<div>**
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The **<div>** element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the **containing** element.

```
A box may be nested inside
several other block-level
elements. The containing
element is always the direct
parent of that element.
```

The orange lines in this diagram represent **<div>** elements. The
header (containing the logo and navigation) are in one **<div>** element,
the main content of the page is in another, and the footer is in a third.

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
```

```
normal flow
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-by-
side, they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).
```

```
relative Positioning
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.
```

```
aB solute Positioning
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.
```

```
The paragraphs appear one
after the other, vertically down
the page.
```

```
The second paragraph has been
pushed down and right from
where it would otherwise have
been in normal flow.
```

```
The heading is positioned to the
top right, and the paragraphs
start at the top of the screen (as
if the heading were not there).

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use

box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom

and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we

introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)

**fixed Positioning**
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.

```
floating elements
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.
```

When you move
any element from
normal flow, boxes
can overlap. The
**z-index** property
allows you to control
which box appears
on top.
The heading has been placed in
the center of the page and 25%
from the top of the screen. (The
rest appears in normal flow.)

```
The heading has been floated to
the left, allowing the paragraphs
of text to flow around it.
```

```

```
In normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one. Since this is the default
way in which browsers treat
HTML elements, you do not
need a CSS property to indicate
that elements should appear
in normal flow, but the syntax
would be:
```

```
position: static;
```

```
I have not specified a width
property for the heading
element, so you can see how it
stretches the width of the entire
browser window by default.
```

```
The paragraphs are restricted
to 450 pixels wide. This shows
how the elements in normal flow
start on a new line even if they
do not take up the full width of
the browser window.
```

All of the examples that
demonstrate positioning will use
a similar HTML structure.

element in relation to where it

```
For example, you can move it 10
pixels lower than it would have
been in normal flow or 20% to
the right.
```

```
You can indicate that an element
should be relatively positioned
using the position property
with a value of relative.
```

```
You then use the offset
properties ( top or bottom and
left or right ) to indicate how
far to move the element from

```

```
To move the box up or down,
you can use either the top or
bottom properties.
```

```
To move the box horizontally,
you can use either the left or

```

```
The values of the box offset
properties are usually given in

When the position property
is given a value of absolute ,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page. (They act like it is not
there.)
```

```
The box offset properties ( top
or bottom and left or right )
specify where the element
should appear in relation to its
containing element.
```

```
In this example, the heading has
been positioned at the top of the
page and 500 pixels from its left
edge. The width of the heading is
set to be 250 pixels wide.
```

```
The width property has
also been applied to the <p>
elements in this example
to prevent the text from
overlapping and becoming
unreadable.
```

```
By default, most browsers add
a margin to the top of the <h1>
element. This is why there is
a gap between the top of the
browser and the box containing
the <h1> element. If you wanted
to remove this margin, you could
add the following code to the
<h1> element's style rules:
margin: 0px;
```

```
LAYOUTLAYOUT 368368
```

```
Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.
```

```
It positions the element in
relation to the browser window.
Therefore, when a user scrolls
down the page, it stays in the
exact same place. It is a good
idea to try this example in your
browser to see the effect.
```

```
To control where the fixed
position box appears in relation
to the browser window, the box
offset properties are used.
```

```
In this example, the heading
has been positioned to the top
left hand corner of the browser
window. When the user scrolls
down the page, the paragraphs
disappear behind the heading.
```

```
The <p> elements are in normal
flow and ignore the space that
the <h1> element would have
taken up. Therefore, the
margin-top property has
been used to push the first <p>
element below where the fixed
position <h1> element is sitting.
```

chapter-15/z-index.html Css
```

```
When you use relative, fixed, or
absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those
that are earlier in the page.
```

```
If you want to control which
element sits on top, you can use
the z-index property. Its value
is a number, and the higher the
number the closer that element
is to the front. For example, an
element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one
with a z-index of 5.
```

```
This example looks similar to
the one on page 368, but it
uses relative positioning for
the <p> elements. Because
the paragraphs are relatively
positioned, by default they
would appear over the top of the
heading as the user scrolls down
the page. To ensure that the
<h1> element stays on top, we
use the z-index property on the
rule for the <h1> element.
```

```
The z-index is sometimes
referred to as the stacking
context (as if the blocks have
been stacked on top of each
other on a z axis). If you are
familiar with desktop publishing
packages, it is the equivalent
of using the 'bring to front' and
'send to back' features.

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.
```

```
Anything else that sits inside
the containing element will
flow around the element that is
floated.
```

```
When you use the float
property, you should also use the
width property to indicate how
wide the floated element should
be. If you do not, results can be
inconsistent but the box is likely
to take up the full width of the
containing element (just like it
would in normal flow).
```

```
In this example, a
<blockquote> element is
used to hold a quotation. It's
containing element is the

The <blockquote> element
is floated to the right, and the

flow around the floated element.

chapter-15/using-float.html HtMl
```

```
A lot of layouts place boxes
next to each other. The float
property is commonly used to
achieve this.
```

```
When elements are floated, the
height of the boxes can affect
where the following elements sit.
```

```
In this example, you can see six
paragraphs, each of which has a
width and a float property set.
```

```
The fourth paragraph does not
go across to the left hand edge
of the page as one might expect.
Rather it sits right under the
third paragraph.
```

```
The reason for this is that the
fourth paragraph has space to
start under the third paragraph,
but it cannot go any further to
the left because the second
paragraph is in the way.
```

```
Setting the height of the
paragraphs to be the same
height as the tallest paragraph
would solve this issue, but it
is rarely suited to real world
designs where the amount of
text in a paragraph or column
may vary. It is more common
to use the clear property
(discussed on the next page) to
solve this issue.
```

The clear property allows you
to say that no element (within
the same containing element)
should touch the left or right-
hand sides of a box. It can take
the following values:
```

```
left
The left-hand side of the box
should not touch any other
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
```

```
right
The right-hand side of the
box will not touch elements
appearing in the same containing
element.
```

```
both
Neither the left nor right-hand
sides of the box will touch
elements appearing in the same
containing element.
```

```
none
Elements can touch either side.
```

```
In this example, the fourth
paragraph has a class called
clear. The CSS rule for this
class uses the clear property
to indicate that nothing should
touch the left-hand side of it. The
fourth paragraph is therefore
moved further down the page
so no other element touches its
left-hand side.

Traditionally, developers got
around this problem by adding
an extra element after the
last floated box (inside the
containing element). A CSS
rule would be applied to this
additional element setting the
clear property to have a value
of both. But this meant that an
extra element was added to the
HTML just to fix the height of the
containing element.
```

```
More recently, developers have
opted for a purely CSS-based
solution because it means that
there is no need to add an extra
element to the HTML page after
the floated elements. The pure
CSS solution adds two CSS rules
to the containing element (in this
example the <div> element):
```

● (^) The **overflow** property is
given a value **auto**.
● (^) The **width** property is set to
**100%**.

Many web pages use multiple
columns in their design. This
is achieved by using a <div>
element to represent each
column. The following three CSS
properties are used to position
the columns next to each other:
```

```
width
This sets the width of the
columns.
```

```
float
This positions the columns next
to each other.
```

```
margin
This creates a gap between the
columns.
```

```
A two-column layout like the one
shown on this page would need
two <div> elements, one for the
main content of the page and
one for the sidebar.
```

```
Inside each of the <div>
elements there can be headings,
paragraphs, images, and even
other <div> elements.

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
```

sC reen sizes

```
When designing for print, you
always know the size of the
piece of paper that your design
will be printed on. However,
when it comes to designing for
the web, you are faced with the
unique challenge that different
users will have different sized
screens.
```

```
Since computers have been sold
to the public, the size of screens
has been steadily increasing.
This means that some people
viewing your site might have 13
inch monitors while others may
have 27+ inch monitors.
```

```
The size of a user's screen
affects how big they can open
their windows and how much
of the page they will see. There
are also an increasing number
of handheld devices (mobile
phones and tablets) that have
smaller screens.
```

```
iPhone 4
Size: 3.5 inches

```

```
iPad 2
Size: 9.7 inches
Resolution: 1024 x 768 pixels
```

```
LAYOUT 378
```

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some

devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most

operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

sC reen resoLution

```
Most computers will allow
owners to adjust the resolution
of the display or the number
of pixels that are shown on the
screen. For example, here you
can see the options to change
the screen size from 720 x 480
pixels up to 1280 x 800 pixels.
```

```
It is interesting to note that
the higher the resolution, the
smaller the text appears. Many
mobile devices have screens
that are higher resolution than
their desktop counterparts.
```

```
13" MacBook

379 LAYOUT

```
Judging the height that people
are likely to see on the screen
without scrolling down the page
is much harder. For several
years, designers assumed that
users would see the top 570-
600 pixels of a page without
having to scroll and some tried
to fit all of the key messages in
this area (fearing that people
would not scroll down the page).
```

```
As screen sizes have increased
and handheld devices have
become more popular, the
area users will see is far more
variable.
```

```
The area of the page that users
would see without scrolling was
often referred as being “above
the fold” (a term newspapers
had originally coined to describe
```

```
the area of the front page you
would see if the paper were
folded in half).
```

```
It is now recognized that if
someone is interested in the
content of the page, they are
likely to scroll down to see more.
Having said which, usability
studies have shown that visitors
can judge a page in under a
second so it is still important to
let new visitors know that the
site is relevant to them and their
interests.
```

```
As a result, many designs still
try to let the user know what the
site is about within the top 570-
600 pixels, as well as hint at
more content below this point.
But do not try to cram too much
into that top area.
```

```
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
```

At the time of writing, there was a growing trend for people to create
adaptive or responsive designs that could change depending on the size
of the screen.

advantagEs

● (^) Pixel values are accurate
at controlling size and
positioning of elements.
● (^) The designer has far greater
control over the appearance
and position of items on the
page than with liquid layouts.
● (^) You can control the lengths
of lines of text regardless of
the size of the user's window.
● (^) The size of an image will
always remain the same
relative to the rest of the
page.
disadvantagEs
● (^) You can end up with big gaps
around the edge of a page.
● (^) If the user's screen is a much
higher resolution than the
designer's screen, the page
can look smaller and text can
be harder to read.
● (^) If a user increases font sizes,
text might not fit into the
allotted spaces.
● (^) The design works best on
devices that have a site or
resolution similar to that of
desktop or laptop computers.
● (^) The page will often take up
more vertical space than a
liquid layout with the same
content.

Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.

advantagEs

● (^) Pages expand to fill the entire
browser window so there are
no spaces around the page
on a large screen.
● (^) If the user has a small
window, the page can
contract to fit it without the
user having to scroll to the
side.
● (^) The design is tolerant of
users setting font sizes larger
than the designer intended
(because the page can
stretch).
disadvantagEs
● (^) If you do not control the
width of sections of the page
then the design can look very
different than you intended,
with unexpected gaps around
certain elements or items
squashed together.
● (^) If the user has a wide
window, lines of text can
become very long, which
makes them harder to read.
● (^) If the user has a very narrow
window, words may be
squashed and you can end up
with few words on each line.
● (^) If a fixed width item (such as
an image) is in a box that is
too small to hold it (because
the user has made the
window smaller) the image
can overflow over the text.
Because liquid layouts can
stretch the entire width of the
browser, resulting in long lines
of text that are hard to read,
some liquid layouts only let part
of the page expand and contract.
Other parts of the page have
minimum and maximum widths.

383 LAYOUT

```
To create a fixed width layout,
the width of the main boxes on
a page will usually be specified
in pixels (and sometimes their
height, too).
```

```
Here you can see several <div>
elements, each of which uses an
id or class attribute to indicate
its purpose on the page.
```

```
In a book like this, the result of
both the fixed and liquid layouts
look similar. To get a real feel for
them, you need to view them in
your browser and see how they
react when you adjust the size of
the browser window.
```

```
The fixed width layout will stay
the same width no matter what
size the browser window is,
whereas the liquid layout will
stretch (or shrink) to fill the
screen.
```

```
The HTML is the same for both
the fixed width layout example
on this page and the liquid layout
example you see next.

The rule for the <body> element
is used to fix the width of the
page at 960 pixels, and it is
centered by setting the left and
right margins to auto.
```

```
The main boxes on the page
have a margin of 10 pixels to
create a gap between them.
```

```
The navigation, feature, and
footer panels stretch to the
width of the containing element
(which in this instance is the
<body> element), so we do not
need to specify a width for them.
```

```
The three columns are each 300
pixels wide and use the float
property, which allows them to
sit next to each other.
```

```
Sometimes an extra HTML
element is used to contain the
page, rather than fixing the
width of the <body>. This allows
the background of the browser
window to have a different color
than the background of the

LAYOUTLAYOUT 386386

```
There is a rule on the <body>
element to set the width of the
page to 90% so that there is a
small gap between the left and
right-hand sides of the browser
window and the main content.
```

```
The three columns are all given
a margin of 1% and a width of
31.3%. This adds up to 99.9%
of the width of the <body>
element, so some browsers
might not perfectly align the
right-hand side of the third
column with other elements on
the page.
```

```
The <div> elements that hold
the navigation, feature, and
footer will stretch to fill the
width of the containing <body>
element. They are given a 1%
margin to help them align with
the columns.
```

```
If you imagine the browser
window to be very wide or very
narrow, you can see how lines of
text could become very long or
very short.
```

```
This is where the min-width
and max-width properties help
create boundaries within which
the layout can stretch (although
Internet Explorer 7 was the first
version of IE to support these
properties).

On the right, you can see a set of
thick vertical lines superimposed
over the top of a newspaper
website to show you how the
page was designed according to
a grid. This grid is called the 960
pixel grid and is widely used by
web designers.
```

```
Grids set consistent proportions
and spaces between items which
helps to create a professional
looking design.
```

```
If you flick back through the
pages of this book you will see
that it, too, has been constructed
according to a grid (comprising
three columns).
```

```
As you will see on pages 389-
390, it is possible to create many
different layouts using this one
versatile grid.
```

```
While a grid might seem like a
restriction, in actual fact it:
```

● (^) Creates a continuity between
different pages which may
use different designs
● (^) Helps users predict where to
find information on various
pages
● (^) Makes it easier to add new
content to the site in a
consistent way
● (^) Helps people collaborate
on the design of a site in a
consistent way
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
```

Css f rameworKs

advantages

● (^) They save you from
repeatedly writing code for
the same tasks.
● (^) They will have been tested
across different browser
versions (which helps avoid
browser bugs).
disadvantages
● (^) They often require that you
use class names in your
HTML code that only control
the presentation of the page
(rather than describe its
content).
● (^) In order to satisfy a wide
variety of needs, they often
contain more code than you
need for your particular web
page (commonly referred to
as code “bloat”).
One of the most popular uses of
CSS frameworks is in creating
grids to layout pages. There
are several grid frameworks
out there, but the one we will
be looking at over the next few
pages is the 960 Grid System
(available at **[http://www.960.gs](http://www.960.gs)** ).
960.gs provides a style sheet
that you can include in your
HTML pages. Once our page
links to this style sheet, you can
provide the appropriate classes
to your HTML code and it will
create multiple column layouts
for you. The 960.gs website
also provides templates you can
download to help design your
pages using a 12 column grid. (In
addition, there is a variation on
the grid that uses 16 columns.)
To create a 12 column grid, an
element that contains the entire
page is given a **class** attibute
whose value is **container_12**.
This sets the content of the
page to be 960 pixels wide and
indicates that we are using a 12
column grid.
There are different classes for
blocks that take up 1, 2, 3, 4,
and up to 12 columns of the grid.
Each block uses class names
such as **grid_3** (for a block that
stretches over three columns),
**grid_4** (for a block that
stretches over 4 columns) and
and so on through to **grid_12**
(for a box that is the full width
of the page). These columns all
float to the left, and there is a 10
pixel margin to the left and the
right of each one.
There are several other grid-
based CSS frameworks available
online, such as those at:

Below you can see a sample layout of a page just like the fixed width

page example. On the next page, we will recreate this using the 960.gs

stylesheet. Instead of writing our own CSS to control layout, we will need

to add classes to the HTML indicating how wide each section should be.

The 960_12_col.css stylesheet
contains all of the rules we need
to control the grid layout. The
HTML uses the class names:
```

```
container_12 to act as a
container for the whole page and
indicate that we are using a 12
column grid
```

```
clearfix to ensure that
browsers know the height of the
containing box, because it only
contains floated elements (this
addresses the issue you met on
pages 371-372)
```

```
grid_12 to create a block that is
twelve columns wide

grid_4 to create a block that is
four columns wide

Some web page authors split
up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets. For
example, they might use one
style sheet to control the layout
and another to control fonts,
colors and so on.
```

```
Some authors take an even
more modular approach
to stylesheets, creating
separate stylesheets to control
typography, layout, forms,
tables, even different styles for
each sub-section of a site.
```

```
There are two ways to add
multiple style sheets to a page:
```

```
1: Your HTML page can link
to one style sheet and that
stylesheet can use the @import
rule to import other style sheets.
```

```
2: In the HTML you can use a
separate <link> element for
each style sheet.
```

```
The example on this page
uses one <link> element in
the HTML to link to a style
sheet called styles.css. This
stylesheet then uses the
@import rule to import the
typography.css and
tables.css files.
```

```
If a styesheet uses the @import
rule, it should appear before the
other rules.
```

muLtip Le s ty Le s heets

LAYOUTLAYOUT 396396
```

```
On this page you can see the
other technique for including
multiple style sheets. Inside the
<head> element is a separate
<link> element for each style
sheet.
```

```
The contents of site.css are
identical to styles.css on the
left hand page, except the code
does not contain @import rules.
```

```
As with all style sheets, if two
rules apply to the same element
then rules that appear later in a
document will take precedence
over previous rules.
```

```
In the example on this page,
any rules in typography.css
would take precedence over
rules in site.css (because the
typography rules are included
after the other rules).
```

```
In the example on the previous
page, the rules in styles.css
would take precedence over the
rules in typography.css. This
is because when the @import
rule is used, that is the point at
which the browser considers the
rules live.

Several classes from the 960.gs style sheet have been added to the code
to indicate how many columns of the grid each element should stretch
across. As you saw in this chapter, the 960.gs stylesheet uses the **float**
property to position the blocks next to each other.

At the start of the page, the header uses fixed positioning (meaning that
it does not move when the user scrolls down the page). The **z-index**
property is added to the header to keep it on top of the remaining
content as the user scrolls down the page.

Both the header and footer are contained within **<div>** elements which
stretch the entire width of the page. Inside those container elements sit
other elements that use classes from the 960.gs style sheet to ensure
that the items in the header and footer align with the rest of the content.

The feature article takes up the entire width of the page. The **push_7**
and **push_9** classes are part of the 960.gs style sheet and are used in
the feature article to move the header and the content for this article
over to the right.

Under the main article you can see four blocks, each of which is 3
columns wide. These contain images followed by links to more articles.

This example also uses background images to create a textured
background for the page and header, and also to contain the images for
the feature article. You will learn more about these in the next chapter.

**Please note:** If you view this example in Internet Explorer 6, the
transparent PNGs used in this design may have a gray background. To
learn more about this issue, visit the website accompanying this book
where you can find a simple JavaScript that fixes this problem.

This example demonstrates a modern

magazine-style layout using the 960.gs grid.

Using this style sheet saves us from having to

create all of the CSS code ourselves.

chapter-16/image-sizes.html HTML
```

```
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
```

```
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
```

```
You might think that your site
is likely to have images of all
different sizes, but a lot of sites
use the same sized image across
many of their pages.
```

```
For example, an e-commerce site
tends to show product photos
at the same size. Or, if your site
is designed on a grid, then you
might have a selection of image
sizes that are commonly used on
all pages, such as:
```

```
Small portrait: 220 x 360
Small landscape: 330 x 210
Feature photo: 620 x 400
```

```
Whenever you use consistently
sized images across a site,
you can use CSS to control
the dimensions of the
images, instead of putting the
dimensions in the HTML.

First you need to determine the
sizes of images that will be used
commonly throughout the site,
then give each size a name.
```

```
For example:
small
medium
large
```

```
Where the <img> elements
appear in the HTML, rather
than using width and height
attributes you can use these
names as values for the class
attribute.
```

```
In the CSS, you add selectors for
each of the class names, then
use the CSS width and height
properties to control the image
dimensions.

```
In the last chapter, you saw how
the float property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.
```

```
Rather than using the <img>
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:
```

```
1: The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).
```

```
2: New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.
```

```
In this example you can see the
align-left and align-right
classes used to align the image.
```

```
It is also common to add a
margin to the image to ensure
that the text does not touch their
edges.

HTML chapter-16/centering-images.html
```

```
By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a block-
level element using the display
property with a value of block.
```

```
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
```

```
1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
```

```
2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.
```

```
You can specify class names
that allow any element to be
centered, in the same way that
you can for the dimensions or
alignment of images.
```

```
The techniques for specifying
image size and alignment of
images can also be used with
the HTML5 <figure> element,
which you met on page 119.

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
```

```
The path to the image follows
the letters url , and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.
```

```
Here is the image
tile used in this
example.
```

```
In the first example, you can
see a background image being
applied to an entire page
(because the CSS selector
applies to the <body> element).
In the second example, the
background image just applies to
a paragraph.
```

```
If you search online, you will
find lots of resources that offer
background textures that you
can use on your pages.
```

```
Background images are often
the last thing on the page to
load (which can make a website
seem slow to load). As with any
images you use online, if the
size of the file is large it will take
longer to download.

When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.

the horizontal position and the
second represents the vertical.

You can also use a pair of pixels
or percentages. These represent
the distance from the top left
corner of the browser window
(or containing box). The top left
corner is equal to 0% 0%. The
example shown, with values of
50% 50%, centers the image
horizontally and vertically.

Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover ) and a third style when
they click on it.
```

```
This is achieved by setting a
background image for the link or
button that has three different
styles of the same button (but
only allows enough space to
show one of them at a time).
You can see the image we are
using in this example on the
right. It actually features two
buttons on the one image.
```

```
When the user moves their
mouse over the element, or
clicks on it, the position of the
background image is moved to
show the relevant image.
```

```
When a single image is used
for several different parts of an
interface, it is known as a sprite.
You can add the logo and other
interface elements, as well as
buttons to the image.
```

```
The advantage of using sprites is
that the web browser only needs
to request one image rather than
many images, which can make
the web page load faster.

In this example, you can see two
links that look like buttons. Each
of the buttons has three different
states. These are all represented
in a single image.
```

```
Because the <a> element is
an inline element, we set the
display property of these links
to indicate that they should be
inline-block elements. This
allows us to specify the width
and height of each <a> element
so that it matches the size of its
corresponding button.
```

```
The background-position
property is used to move the
image in order to show the
button in the right state.
```

```
When the user hovers over a
link, the :hover pseudo-class
has a rule that moves the
background-position of the
image to show a different state
for that button.
```

```
Similarly, when the user clicks on
the link, the :active pseudo-
class has a rule to show the third
state for that button.
```

```
Touch screen devices will not
change a link's state when
the user hovers over it, as the
screens do not yet have a way
to tell when the user is hovering.
However, they will change their
appearance when the user
activates them.

CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.
```

```
Since it is not supported by all
browsers, it is possible to specify
a background image for the box
first (which would represent the
gradient) and then provide the
CSS alternatives for browsers
that support gradients.
```

```
On this page, we are focusing
on linear gradients. You can see
that in order to create a linear
gradient, we need to specify
two colors (that the gradient is
between).
```

```
Some browsers allow you
to specify the angle of the
gradient, or even different types
of gradients (such as radial
gradients), but support is not
as widespread as that for linear
gradients.
```

```

Image editing applications such

To overlay text on an image with

A background texture is applied to the whole page by repeating an
image with the texture behind the **<body>** element. A repeating
background image is sometimes referred to as **wallpaper**.

The content of the page is put inside a **<div>** element whose class is
**wrapper**. This is used to fix the width of the page to 720 pixels. Its left
and right margins are set to **auto** to center it in the middle of the screen.

The images sit inside an HTML5 **<figure>** element, and their captions
are provided in the **<figcaption>** element. CSS is used to set the
dimensions and background color for each **<figure>** element. The
dimensions of the images themselves are also set using CSS, and they
are given a single pixel gray border.

For the captions, a background image is used to the left of the text. We
do not want this image to fill the background so we specify that it should
not repeat. Padding is used to the left of the text so that the words do
not go over the background image.

Each of the **<figure>** elements is contained within a **<div>** , which has
two purposes. Firstly, it is used to create the three-column layout by
specifying a width and margins for the element and then floating it to
the left. Secondly, it adds a subtle shadow underneath each image. This
creates a three-dimensional appearance making it look like a piece of
card. To ensure that this sits underneath the image, the **background-
position** property is used.

This example demonstrates how to use CSS to

create a simple image gallery layout.

HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
```

```
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
```

● (^) The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
● (^) How they offer helpful alternatives to the **<div>** element
● (^) How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

HTML5 LAYOUT 430

431 HTML5 LAYOUT

```
On the right you can see a
layout that is quite common
(particularly on blog sites).
```

```
At the top of the page is the
header, containing a logo and the
primary navigation.
```

```
Under this are one or more
articles or posts. Sometimes
these are summaries that link to
individual posts.
```

```
There is a side bar on the right-
hand side (perhaps featuring
a search option, links to other
recent articles, other sections of
the site, or even ads).
```

```
When coding a site like this,
developers would usually put
these main sections of the page
inside <div> elements and use
the class or id attributes to
indicate the purpose of that part
of the page.
```

```
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
```

```

```

```
HTML5 LAYOUT 432
```

```
This example has exactly the
same structure as seen on the
previous page. However, many
of the <div> elements have been
replaced by new HTML5 layout
elements.
```

```
For example, the header sits
inside a new <header> element,
the navigation in a <nav>
element, and the articles are in
individual <article> elements.
```

```
The point of creating these
new elements is so that web
page authors can use them to
help describe the structure of
the page. For example, screen
reader software might allow
users to ignore headers and
footers and get straight to
the content. Similarly, search
engines might place more
weight on the content in an
<article> element than that
in the <header> or <footer>
elements. I think you will agree
that it also makes the code
easier to follow.
```

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the

parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content

you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not

stopped many web page authors using them already.

```
The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
```

● (^) The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● (^) A header or footer for an
individual **<article>** or
**<section>** within the page.
In this example, the **<header>**
element used to contain the site
name and the main navigation.
The **<footer>** element contains
copyright information, along
with links to the privacy policy
and terms and conditions.
Each individual **<article>** and
**<section>** element can also
have its own **<header>** and
**<footer>** elements to hold the
header or footer information for
that section within the page.
For example, on a page with
several blog posts, each
individual post can be thought
of as a separate section. The
**<header>** element can therefore
be used to contain the title and
date of each individual post, and
the **<footer>** might contain
links to share the article on
social networking sites.

code shown in this chapter

```
The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.
```

```
Going back to our blog example,
if you wanted to finish an article
with links to related blog posts,
these would not be counted as
major navigational blocks and
therefore should not sit inside a
<nav> element.
```

```
At the time of writing, some of
the developers that were already
using HTML5 decided to use the
<nav> element for the links that
appear at the bottom of every
page (links to things like privacy
policy, terms and conditions
and accessibility information).
Whether this will be widely
adopted is still yet to be seen.

The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
```

```
This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content.
```

```
If a page contains several articles
(or even summaries of several
articles), then each individual
article would live inside its own
<article> element.
```

```
The <article> elements can
even be nested inside each
other. For example, a blog post
might live inside one <article>
element and each comment on
the article could live inside its
own child <article> element.

```
The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not.
```

```
When the <aside> element
is used inside an <article>
element, it should contain
information that is related to the
article but not essential to its
overall meaning. For example, a
pullquote or glossary might be
considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.
```

```
When the <aside> element is
used outside of an <article>
element, it acts as a container
for content that is related to
the entire page. For example,
it might contain links to other
sections of the site, a list of
recent posts, a search box, or
recent tweets by the author.

chapter-17/example.html HTML
```

```
The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
```

```
For example, on a homepage
there may be several <section>
elements to contain different
sections of the page, such as
latest news, top products, and
newsletter signup.
```

```
Because the <section> element
groups related items together,
it may contain several distinct
<article> elements that have a
common theme or purpose.
```

```
Alternatively, if you have a
page with a long article, the
<section> element can be
used to split the article up into
separate sections.
```

```
The <section> element should
not be used as a wrapper for
the entire page (unless the
page only contains one distinct
piece of content). If you want a
containing element for the entire
page, that job is still best left to
the <div> element.
```

```
The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.
```

```
For example, the <hgroup>
element could be used to contain
both a title inside an <h2>
element and a subtitle within an
<h3> element.
```

```
This element has had a mixed
reception. When it was first
proposed by the people
developing HTML5, there were
some complaints and it was
withdrawn from the HTML5
proposals. However, some
people changed their minds and
it has been added it back into the
language. Some developers do
not like the use of the <hgroup>
element, and prefer to place a
subtitle inside a <p> element
(using an attribute to indicate
that it is a subheading).
```

```
Some suggest that it is of little
use other than as a styling hook.
It has, however, been popular
with those developers who
believe that it is useful to group
together the primary heading
and the subheading (as both can
be integral parts of a heading).

```
You already met the <figure>
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images).
```

```
It is important to note that the
article should still make sense
if the content of the <figure>
element were moved (to another
part of the page, or even to a
different page altogether).
```

```
For this reason, it should only be
used when the content simply
references the element (and not
for something that is absolutely
integral to the flow of a page).
```

```
Examples of usage include:
```

● (^) Images
● (^) Videos
● (^) Graphs
● (^) Diagrams
● (^) Code samples
● (^) Text that supports the main
body of an article
The **<figure>** element should
also contain a **<figcaption>**
element which provides a text
decription for the content of
the **<figure>** element. In
this example, you can see a
**<figure>** has been added inside
the **<article>** element.

It may seem strange to follow
these new elements by revisiting
the <div> element again. (After
all, the new elements are often
going to be used in its place.)
```

```
However, the <div> element
will remain an important way to
group together related elements,
because you should not be using
these new elements that you
have just met for purposes other
than those explicitly stated.
```

```
Where there is no suitable
element to group a set of
elements, the <div> element will
still be used. In this example, it is
used as a wrapper for the entire
page.
```

```
Some people have asked why
there is no <content> element
to contain the main part of
a page. The reason is that
anything that lies outside of the
<header> , <footer> or <aside>
elements can be considered as
the main content.

HTML5 allows web page authors
to place an <a> element around
a block level element that
contains child elements. This
allows you to turn an entire block
into a link.

This is not a new element in
HTML5, but it was not seen as a
correct usage of the <a> element
in earlier versions of HTML.

```
Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as
inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new
elements should be rendered as
block-level elements.
```

```
Also, IE9 was the first version of
Internet Explorer to allow CSS
rules to be associated with these
new HTML5 layout elements.
In order to style these elements
using earlier versions of IE, you
need to use a simple JavaScript
known as the HTML5 shiv or
HTML5 shim.
```

```
You do not need to understand
JavaScript to use it. You can
just link to a copy that Google
hosts on its servers. It should
be placed inside a conditional
comment which checks if the
browser version is less than
(hence the lt ) IE9.
```

```
Unfortunately, this workaround
does require that anyone using
IE8 or earlier versions of IE
has JavaScript enabled in their
browser. If they do not have
JavaScript enabled then they will
not be able to see the content of
these HTML5 elements.

HTML5 LAYOUT 444
```

The header and footer of the page sit inside **<header>** and **<footer>**
elements. The courses are grouped together inside a **<section>**
element that has a **class** attribute whose value is **courses** (to
distinguish it from other **<section>** elements on the page). The sidebar
sits inside an **<aside>** element.

Each of the courses lives inside an **<article>** element, and use the
**<figure>** and **<figcaption>** elements to contain an image. The
headings for the courses have subheadings, so these are grouped inside
an **<hgroup>** element. In the sidebar, the recipes and contact details are
placed inside separate **<section>** elements.

The page is styled using CSS. The only difference is that our selectors
are using the new HTML5 elements to allow us to create rules that
target those elements. In order for the CSS to work in versions of IE
before Internet Explorer 9, the HTML5 page contains a link to the
HTML5 shiv JavaScript (hosted on Google's servers) inside a
conditional comment.

This example shows a cooking site built using

new HTML5 elements to describe the structure

of the page (rather than just grouping items

using **<div>** elements).

It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:
```

● (^) How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it
● (^) How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for
● (^) Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals
● (^) Design tips to help you create more attractive and

Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
```

Who is the site For?

target auDience: inDivi Duals

● (^) What is the age range of your target audience?
● (^) Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● (^) Which country do your visitors live in?
● (^) Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● (^) What is the average income of visitors?
● (^) What level of education do they have?
● (^) What is their marital or family status?
● (^) What is their occupation?
● (^) How many hours do they work per week?
● (^) How often do they use the web?
● (^) What kind of device do they use to access the web?
target auDience: com Panies
● (^) What is the size of the company or relevant department?
● (^) What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
● (^) Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
● (^) How large is the budget they control?
It can be helpful to ask some
questions about the people you
would expect to be interested in
the subject of your site.
If you ask a client who a site is
for, it is not uncommon for them
to answer "the entire world."
Realistically, it is unlikely to be
relevant to everyone. If your site
sells light bulbs, even though
most people using a computer
probably use light bulbs, they
are not likely to order them from
someone in a different country.
Even if the site has a wide
appeal, you can still think about
the demographics of a sample of
the target audience.

If you have a question about how
the site is going to be used, or
what its priorities should be, you
```

```
will be able to think back and ask
yourself, "What would Gordon
or Molly want in this situation?"
```

457 PROCESS

```
Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.
```

```
To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:
```

```
1: The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.
```

```
2: The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.
These are the triggers making
them come to the site now.
```

Key motivations

● (^) Are they looking for general
entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
● (^) If there is a specific goal, is
it a personal or professional
one?
● (^) Do they see spending time on
this activity as essential or a
luxury?
sP eci Fic goals
● (^) Do they want general
information / research (such
as background on a topic /
company), or are they after
something specific (such as a
particular fact or information
on a product)?
● (^) Are they already familiar with
the service or product that
you offer or do they need to
be introduced to it?
● (^) Are they looking for time
sensitive information, such as
the latest news or updates on
a particular topic?
● (^) Do they want to discover
information about a specific
product or service to help
them decide whether to buy
it or not?
● (^) Do they need to contact you?
If so, can they visit in person
(which might require opening
hours and a map)? Or might
they need email or telephone
contact details?
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider **why** they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
Why PeoPle v isit
your Website

```
PROCESS 458
```

First you want to create a list
of reasons why people would
be coming to your site. You can
then assign the list of tasks to
the fictional visitors you created
in the step described on the
previous page.

```
GOrdON bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to
purchase one from your site for his girlfriend.
```

```
mOLLy has read about your new doggy daycare service in the press and
wants to find out whether it would be suitable for her to use.
```

```
Jasper had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney,
Australia, and wants to make a complaint.
```

```
ayO hopes to study architecture and wants to learn more about a new
course that is being offered.
```

```
Ivy is a picture editor and wants to look at a photographer's site to see
examples of his work before deciding whether to commission him.
```

```
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.
```

What your visitors are

trying to achieve

459 PROCESS

```
You may want to offer additional
supporting information that you
think they might find helpful.
```

```
Look at each of the reasons why
people will be visiting your site
and determine what they need to
achieve their goals.
```

```
You can prioritize levels of
information from key points
down to non-essential or
background information.
```

```
By ensuring that you provide the
information that your visitors
are looking for, they will consider
your site more relevant to them.
```

```
Therefore, you will have more
opportunity to tell them any
extra information that you think
would be helpful to them (or to
expose them to other products
and services you want to
promote).
```

```
If you do not appear relevant to
them by answering their needs,
however, they are likely to go
elsewhere.
```

```
Here are some questions to help
you decide what information to
provide for visitors to your site...
```

Key inFormation

● (^) Will visitors be familiar with
your subject area / brand
or do you need to introduce
yourself?
● (^) Will they be familiar with
the product / service /
information you are covering
or do they need background
information on it?
● (^) What are the most important
features of what you are
offering?
● (^) What is special about what
you offer that differentiates
you from other sites that offer
something similar?
● (^) Once people have achieved
the goal that sent them to
your site, are there common
questions people ask about
this subject area?
You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively.

A website about fashion trends
will need to change a lot more
frequently than one that is
promoting a service that people
do not buy regularly (such as
domestic plumbing or double
glazing).

Once a site has been built, it can
take a lot of time and resources
to update it frequently.

Working out how often people
are likely to revisit your site gives
you an indication for how often
you should update the site.

```
It can often be helpful to set a
schedule for when a site will be
updated (rather than doing it on
an ad hoc basis).
```

```
You will often find that some
parts of a site will benefit from
being updated more frequently
than others.
```

```
Here are some questions to help
you decide how often to update
your website content...
```

gooDs / s ervices

● (^) How often do the same
people return to purchase

● (^) How often is your stock

● (^) How often is the subject
updated?
● (^) What percentage of your
visitors would return for
regular updates on the
subject, compared with
those who will just need the
information once?
Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.

461 PROCESS

```
The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
```

```
To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.
```

```
This involves placing each
piece of information that a
visitor might need to know on
a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related
information into groups.
```

```
Each group relates to a page and,
on larger sites the, pages can in
turn can be grouped together to
create different sections of the
website.
```

```
The groups of information are
then turned into the diagram
that is known as the site map.
```

```
Sometimes it can be helpful to
ask people who are the target
audience to help you group
related information together.
```

```
A site map will usually
begin with the homepage.
Additionally, if the site is large
and is compartmentalized
into sections, each section
might require its own section
homepage to link to all of the
information within it.
```

```
For example, most online shops
have section homepages for
each type of product, which then
in turn link to individual product
pages.
```

```
You may need to duplicate some
information if it needs to appear
on more than one page.
```

```
The pages (or groups of pages)
will inform how users navigate
through the site.
```

```
Remember to focus on the
goals that your visitors want to
achieve.
```

```
It is worth noting that the
site owner might organize
information in a way that is
different to what the public
expects. It is important to reflect
the public's understanding of the
subject (rather than just the site
owner's understanding of it).
```

```
Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

```
A lot of designers will take the
elements that need to appear on
each page and start by creating
wireframes. This involves
sketching or shading areas
where each element of the page
will go (such as the logo, primary
navigation, headings and main
bodies of text, user logins etc).
```

```
By creating a wireframe you can
ensure that all of the information
that needs to be on a page is
included.
```

```
You should not include the
color scheme, font choices,
backgrounds or images for
the website in the wireframe.
It should focus on what
information needs to be on
each page and create a visual
hierarchy to indicate the most
important parts of each page.
```

```
The wireframes make design
easier because you know what
information needs to appear on
which page before considering
```

```
how the the page should look.
It can be very helpful to show the
wireframes of a site to a client
before showing them a design.
It enables the client to ensure
the site has all the functions and
information it needs to offer.
```

```
If you just present a site design
to a client, it is common for them
to focus on how the site looks,
which means they may not raise
issues about its function after
the site has been built.
```

```
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
```

WireFrames

The example on the right was
created in Photoshop using the
templates that come with the

content
Web pages often have a lot of
information to communicate.
For example, the pages of
online newspapers will have
information that does not appear
on every page of the print
equivalent:
```

● (^) A masthead or logo
● (^) Links to navigate the site
● (^) Links to related content and
other popular articles
● (^) Login or membership options
● (^) Ability for users to comment
● (^) Copyright information
● (^) Links to privacy policies,
terms and conditions,
advertising information, RSS
feeds, subscription options
With so much on the page, the
designer needs to **organize** and
**prioritize** the information to
communicate their message
and help users find what they're
looking for.
Prioritizing
If everything on a page appeared
in the same style, it would be
much harder to understand. (Key
messages would not stand out.)
By making parts of the page
look **distinct** from surrounding
content, designers draw
attention to (or away from)
those items.
Designers create something
known as a **visual hierarchy**
to help users focus on the key
messages that will draw people's
attention, and then guide them
to subsequent messages.
We look at visual hierarchy on
pages 467-468.
organizing
**Grouping** together related
content into **blocks** or **chunks**
makes the page look simpler
(and easier to understand).
Users should be able to
identify the purpose of each
block without processing each
individual item.
By presenting certain types of
information in a **similar** visual
style (such as using the same
style for all buttons or all links),
users will learn to associate that
style with a particular type of
content.
We look at grouping and
similarity on pages 469-470.
The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

```
PROCESS 466
```

Let's look at an example of how
design can be used to effectively
communicate the services of a
company.

visual hierarchy

Attention is immediately drawn
to a picture that shows the
service this company offers
and a headline to explain it. The
size and colored background
reinforce that this is the primary
message on the page.

Should this service appeal to the
user, below they can see more
detail about what it does, how
much it costs, and who uses it.

```
grou Ping
There are several chunks of
information on this page.
```

```
At the top you can see the logo
and navigation. Under this is the
information that introduces the
company's services.
```

```
Further down are three distinct
groups showing you what the
services do, the costs involved
and some of the services' users.
```

```
similarity
There are several examples of
similarity within this page.
```

```
The four points (at the bottom
left of the screenshot) are all
presented in a similar manner
with consistent headings and
icons.
```

```
All of the links in the body text
are in blue so it is clear what text
is clickable.
```

467 PROCESS

```
Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
```

visual hierarchy

```
Lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing elit. Lorem

consectetur adipscing elit.
```

```
size
Larger elements will grab users'
attention first. For this reason it
is a good idea to make headings
and key points relatively large.
```

```
color
Foreground and background
color can draw attention to key
messages. Brighter sections tend
to draw users' attention first.
```

```
style
An element may be the same
size and color as surrounding
content but have a different style
applied to it to make it stand out.
```

```
Lorem ipsum dolor

```

```
PROCESS 468
```

**visual hierarchy** refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what

they see. It is created by adding **visual contrast** between the items being

displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

```
images
Images create a high visual
contrast and often attract the
eye first. They can be used to
draw attention to a specific
message within the page. In
some cases, the right image can
succinctly reveal more than an
entire page of text.
```

```
The effect of a well-designed
visual hierarchy is largely
subliminal. Achieving a good
hierarchy requires balance; if
nothing stands out a site can be
rather uninteresting, and if too
many aspects are competing
for your attention it can be hard
to find the key messages. This
example has a clear hierarchy
which addresses the needs of
visitors to the site.
```

469 PROCESS

```
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.
```

grouPing anD

similarity

Proximity

```
When several items are
placed close together, they are
perceived as more related than
items that are placed further
apart. (You can also nest groups
of information within larger
groups of information.)
```

closure

```
When faced with a complicated
arrangement of items, we
will often look for a single or
recognisable pattern or form.
A real or imaginary box can be
formed around elements due to
their proximity and alignment.
```

continuance

```
When elements are placed in
a line or a curve then they are
perceived to be more related
than those that are not following
the same direction. This can be
used to direct a reader from one
part of a page to the next.
```

White sPace

```
Placing related items closer
together and leaving a bigger
gap between unrelated items.
```

color

```
A background color placed
behind related items to
emphasize their connection.
```

bor Ders

```
A line can be drawn around the
border of the group or between it
and its neighbors.
```

```
PROCESS 470
```

We naturally observe similarities in design, and things that are similar are

perceived to be more related than things that are dissimilar. Repetition

of similar color, size, orientation, texture, font, or shape, suggests that

matching elements have similar importance or meaning.

```
consistency
In this example each book
review has a consistent style for
the book titles, author names,
and purchasing links. Having
read just one of the blocks it is
possible to infer the meaning of
the other items in this box that
follow the same style.
```

```
heaD ings
Giving a chunk of information
a heading clearly tells the user
whether or not the content of
the grouping is relevant to them.
If not, they can ignore all of the
elements within it. It also helps
users of screen readers, as users
often have the option to hear the
headings on the page.

```
the Basics
```

```
Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
```

```
At the heart of SEO is the idea of
working out which terms people
are likely to enter into a search
engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right
places on your site to increase
the chances that search engines
will show a link to your site in
their results.
```

```
In order to determine who comes
first in the search results, search
engines do not only look at what
appears on your site. They also
consider how many sites link
to you (and how relevant those
links are). For this reason, SEO
is often split into two areas:
on-page techniques and off-page
techniques.
```

```
on-Page techniques
```

```
On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.
```

```
The main component of this is
looking at keywords that people
are likely to enter into a search
engine if they wanted to find
your site, and then including
these in the text and HTML code
for your site in order to help the
search engines know that your
site covers these topics.
```

```
Search engines rely very heavily
on the text that is in your pages
so it is important that the terms
people are going to search for
are in text. There are seven
essential places where you want
your keywords to appear.
```

```
Ensuring that any images have
appropriate text in the value of
their alt attribute also helps
search engines understand the
content of images.
```

```
off-Page techniques
```

```
Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.
```

```
They are particularly interested
in sites whose content is related
to yours. For example, if you
were running a website that
sold fish bait, then a link from
a hairdresser is not likely to be
considered as relevant as one
from an angling community.
```

```
Search engines also look at the
words between the opening
<a> tag and closing </a> tag
in the link. If the text in the link
contains keywords (rather than
just click here or your website
address) it may be considered
more relevant.
```

```
The words that appear in links to
your site should also appear in
the text of the page that the site
links to.
```

```
SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.
```

oPtimization (seo )

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 480
```

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords

(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order

to improve its findability.

on-Page seo

1: Page title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the **<title>** element which lives
inside the **<head>** element.

2: url / WeB a ddress
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

3: h eadings
If the keywords are in a heading
**<h** _n_ **>** element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

4: t ext
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.

```
5: l ink text
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").
```

```
6: i mage alt t ext
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.
```

```
7: Page descriPtions
The description also lives inside
the <head> element and is
specified using a <meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)
```

```
Never try to fool search engines!
They will penalize you for it. For
example, never add text in the
same color as the background of
the page as they can detect this.

1: Brainstorm
```

```
List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.
```

```
It often helps to ask other people
what words they would use to
find your site because people
less familiar with a topic might
use different terms than you. (In
particular, they are less likely to
use industry-specific jargon.)
```

```
Your list may include some
keyword phrases (not just
individual words) if you have
topics which are described by
more than one word.
```

```
2: o rganize
```

```
Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.
```

```
For example, if your website
was a pet shop you might have
different categories for different
animals (such as dogs, cats and
rabbits).
```

```
On a large site you may
break this up further into
sub-categories (for example,
separate groups for different pet
food brands).
```

```
3: r esearch
```

```
There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider, such as:
adwords.google.co.uk/
select/KeywordToolExternal
(When using this tool, select the
"exact match" option rather than
"broad match.")
http://www.wordtracker.com
http://www.keyworddiscovery.com
```

```
Once these tools have suggested
additional keywords, add the
relevant options to your lists.
(Keyword tools will most likely
suggest some terms that are
irrelevant so do omit any that do
not seem appropriate).
```

```
Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.
```

hoW to identify

key Words and Phrases

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 482
```

4: comPare

It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.

Some of the keyword research
sites can tell you how many
people have searched for a
specific keyword to help you
know how much competition
those terms have.

You can also use Google's
advanced search feature to
just search the titles of web
pages. This will help you to
determine how many sites have
that keyword in the title of their
pages. (The more pages with
the term in the title, the more
competition there is.)

```
5: r efine
```

```
Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.
```

```
If there is a phrase that is very
relevant but you find there is a
lot of competition, you should
still use it. To improve the
chances of your site being found
you can look at whether there
are other words that could be
incorporated into a phrase. For
example, if the information or
service you offer on your website
is location specific, then you will
often find that incorporating
your location into your keyword
list will help people find you.
```

```
If your site is promoting a slate
roofing company in Australia
then it is better to get 100
people from Australia who are
looking for a slate roof than
10,000 from the USA who are
looking for other kinds of rooves.
```

```
6: m aP
```

```
Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.
```

```
Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases
that map to each page of your
website and use these as the
keywords for each page.
```

```
You should not need to repeat
the same keywords on all of
the pages. It is also likely that,
as you move further away from
the homepage into the sections
of the site, the keywords will
become more specific to the
individual topic dealt with on
each page.
```

483 PRACTICAL INFORMATION

```
signing uP
```

```
The Google Analytics service
relies on you signing up for an
account at:
http://www.google.com/analytics
The site will give you a piece of
tracking code which you need to
put on every page of your site.
```

```
hoW it Works
```

```
Every time someone loads a
page of your site, the tracking
code sends data to the Google
servers where it is stored.
Google then provides a web-
based interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.
```

```
the tracking code
```

```
A tracking code is provided
by Google Analytics for each
website you are tracking. It
should appear just before the
closing </head> tag. The code
does not alter the appearance of
your web pages.
```

```
As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.
```

analytics: learning

aBout your Visitors

```
At the time of writing, Google
was updating their Analytics
interface to Version 5. If you
log into your account and see a
different interface, look for a link
in the top right-hand corner of
the page that says 'New Version.'
```

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 484
```

Visits
This is the number of times
people have come to your site. If
someone is inactive on your site
for 30 minutes and then looks at
another page on your site, it will
be counted as a new visit.

```
unique Visits
This is the total number of
people who have visited your site
over the specified period. The
number of unique visits will be
lower than the number of visits
if people have been returning to
your site more than once in the
defined period.
```

```
Page VieWs
The total number of pages all
visitors have viewed on your site.
```

```
Pages Per Visit
The average number of pages
each visitor has looked at on
your site per visit.
```

```
aV erage time on site
The average amount of time
each user has spent on the site
per visit.
```

```
date selector
Using the date selector in the top
right hand corner of the site, you
can change the period of time
the reports display. When you
log in, this is usually set to the
last month, but you can change
it to report on a specific time
period.
```

```
exPort
The export link just above the
title that says "visitors overview"
allows you to export the
statistics on this page for other
applications such as Excel.
```

The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are

likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are

coming to your site.

hoW m any PeoPle a re

485 PRACTICAL INFORMATION

```
The content link on the left-hand side allows
you to learn more about what the visitors are
looking at when they come to your site.
```

What are y our Visitors

looking at?

```
Pages
This tells you which pages your
visitors are looking at the most
and also which pages they are
spending the most time on.
```

```
landing Pages
These are the pages that people
arrive on when first visiting your
site. This can be particularly
helpful because you may find
people are not always coming
into your site via the homepage.
```

```
toP e xit Pages
This shows which pages people
most commonly leave from. If
a lot of people are leaving from
the same page then you might
consider changing that page or
improving it.
```

```
Bounce rate
This shows the number of people
who left on the same page that
they arrived on. A high bounce
rate suggests that the content is
not what they were looking for or
that the page did not sufficiently
encourage them to look around
the rest of the site. What counts
as a bounce:
```

● (^) Clicked a link to another site
● (^) Clicked on an advertisement
● (^) Entered a new URL
● (^) Used the "back" button
● (^) Closed the browser

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 486
```

```
The traffic sources link on the left hand side
allows you to learn where your visitors are
coming from.
```

Where are y our

Visitors coming from?

referrers
This shows the sites that have
linked to you and the number
of people who have come via
those sites. If a site sends a lot
of traffic to you, get in touch and
try to work together to ensure
that traffic keeps flowing. You
could also try to find similar
sites and ask them to link to you.

```
direct
This shows which page a user
arrived on if they did not come
via a link on another site. They
might have typed the URL into
their browser, used a browser
bookmark, or clicked a link in an
email, PDF, or Word document.
```

```
search terms
This shows the terms users
entered into a search engine
to find your site. This can help
you learn how visitors describe
what they're looking for (which is
often different to how someone
might describe their own site).
This can help you fine-tune your
content and your SEO keywords.
```

```
adVanced features
We have only scratched the
surface of what you can find
out about your visitors from
Google Analytics. Their help
files tell you many more of the
advanced features. If you run
an online shop, it is well worth
looking at their e-commerce
tracking, which adds information
about products sold, average
basket size and much more.
You can also set up goals where
you specify the paths you want
people to take, and then see how
far they get through those paths,
which is especially useful when
gathering data from users.
```

487 PRACTICAL INFORMATION

```
In order to put your site on the web you will
need a domain name and web hosting.
```

domain names

& h osting

domain names WeB hosting

```
Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.
```

```
These sites usually have a form
that allows you to check whether
your preferred domain name is
available, and because millions
of domain names have already
been registered, it might take
you a while to find the one that is
right for your site.
```

```
A lot of sites that offer domain
name registration also offer web
hosting.
```

```
disk sPace
This refers to the total size of all
of the files that make up your site
(all of the HTML and CSS files,
images and scripts).
```

```
BandWidth
This is the amount of data the
hosting company will send to
your site's visitors. If you imagine
10 people looked at every page
on your site, then it would be
the equivalent to 10 times the
amount of disk space you use.
```

```
BackuPs
Check whether the hosting
company performs backups on
your site (and how often). Some
only create backups so that
they can restore your website in
the event of a server breaking.
Others allow access to backups
(which can be helpful if you
accidentally break the site when
updating it).
```

```
So that other people can see
your site, you will need to upload
it to a web server. Web servers
are special computers that are
constantly connected to the
Internet. They are specially set
up to serve web pages when
they are requested.
```

```
With the exception of some very
large sites, most websites live on
web servers run by web hosting
companies. This is usually far
cheaper and more reliable than
trying to run your own web
servers.
```

```
There are lots of different types
of hosting on offer. We will now
take a look at some of the key
things that will help you choose
which hosting company to use.
```

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 488
```

email accounts
Most hosting companies will
provide email servers with their
web hosting packages. You will
want to check the size of mailbox
you are allowed and the number
of mailboxes you can use.

ser Ver-side
languages and
dataBases
If you are using a content
management system, it will likely
use a server-side programming
language and a database (such
as PHP with a MySQL database,
or ASP.Net with a SQL Server
database). Be sure to check that
your hosting company supports
the technologies your software
needs to run.

```
It is often worth searching for
reviews of a hosting company
to see what other people's
experience has been with a
hosting company. Unfortunately,
you often can only tell how good
a hosting company is when
something goes wrong, at which
point you find out how they are
able to help you (so you can
expect to see a few negative
reviews for any company).
```

```
There are a number of online
services that allow you to point
your domain name to their
servers. Blogging platforms such
as WordPress.com, Tumblr,
and Posterous, or e-commerce
platforms such as Big Cartel and
Shopify provide the servers that
your site is hosted on. If you are
using a platform like this you
will not need your own hosting
for the website, although you
often still need hosting for your
email. If this is the case, some
web hosting companies offer
packages that will just offer
email services.
```

489 PRACTICAL INFORMATION

```
As the name suggests, File
Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows
you to transfer files across the
Internet from your computer to
the web server hosting your site.
```

```
There are many FTP programs
that offer a simple interface
that shows you the files on your
computer alongside the files that
are on your web server. These
allow you to drag and drop
files from your computer to the
server or vice versa.
```

```
To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.
```

ft P & third Party tools

```
PRACTICAL INFORMATION 490
```

```
There are a wide variety of sites that offer
services commonly created by web developers
(to save you having to build them yourself).
```

```
Here is a list of some popular
third party tools:
```

```
Blogs
wordpress.com
tu m blr.co m
posterous.com
```

```
e-commerce
shopify.com
bigcartel.com
go.magento.com
```

```
email neWsletters
cam paign m onitor.co m
mailchimp.com
```

```
social netWorking
sharing Buttons
addthis.com
addtoany.com
```

Some hosting companies offer
tools to upload files to their
servers using a web browser, but
it is more common to use an FTP
program as they are faster at
transmitting files.

When you purchase your web
hosting, you will be given FTP
details that you enter into your
FTP program in order to connect
to the server. Usually this will
be an address (such as **ftp://
mydomain.com** ), a username,
and a password. It is important
to keep this information secure
in order to prevent strangers
from gaining access to your
server.

```
Here is a list of some popular
FTP applications:
```

```
FileZilla
filezilla-project.org
Windows, Mac, Linux
```

```
FireFTP
fireftp.mozdev.org
Windows, Mac, Linux

STARTInG OUT

The browser shows the markup
typed in (not the result page).
Check the file extension is _.html_
and not _.txt_. p 30, 32

Bold text, italics, headings, or
link text are extending longer
than expected.
Check you have closed the
relevant tag e.g. **</a>**. p 21, 22

The page I linked to is not found.
Check the relative URL. p 83, 84

IMAGeS

Images are not showing up.
Check the relative URL. p 83, 84

Images are looking blurry.
Check that you have saved your
images in the right format and at
the size you want to show them
at. p 109-113

Border images are not showing.
This only works with latest
browsers. (Also, check the
relative URL). p 319, 21, 22

GIFs that were resized now look
grainy or have jagged edges.
Check the color space in your
image editing program. It should
be RGB (not indexed color).

```
TexT
Some text flashes up before
showing the correct font.
You have a Flash Of Unstyled
Content. p 278
```

```
When copying text from word
processors, lots of extra tags are
added to the markup.
Copy the text into a plain text
editor (to remove formatting)
then paste it into your HTML
editor. p 49
```

```
The text looks bigger/smaller on
some screens.
This is usually due to variances
in screen resolutions. Also,
check the type scale is set for the
<body> element. p 377, 276
```

```
The font size is wrong in IE when
I use ems.
See above. p 276
```

```
The font I specified is not
showing in some browsers.
The computer must have that
font installed. p 269-272
If you are use @font-face it must
be in several formats. p 341
```

```
My fonts look jagged on a PC.
Some fonts to do not anti-alias
as well as others on a PC. Try a
different typeface or try a thicker
version. p 272
```

```
Gene RAL CSS
A specified style is not showing.
Remember CSS selectors are
case sensitive.
```

```
Check that your selectors are
correct. p 238
```

```
The web developer toolbar can
help you find the right selector.
p 348
```

```
If the selectors are correct, do
you have another selector that
applies to the same element
later in the CSS? p 239, 240
```

```
CSS varies in some browsers.
There are a number of CSS
bugs/browser quirks that mean
they render the page slightly
differently - try searching for the
problem and see if it is a known
CSS bug/quirk. p 242
```

```
HTML 5
The browser is not applying
styles to HTML5 elements.
If it is IE, you might need to use
the HTML5 shiv / shim. p442
```

```
Block-level elements are
rendering as inline elements.
Use display:block to tell the
browser which HTML5 elements
are block-level elements. p 442
```

Here are a few problems that beginners commonly face, along with the

pages where you can find solutions to them.

LAYOUT

The design looks bigger/smaller
on some screens.
The resolution of a monitor
affects how big the items appear
on the page. p 377, 378

Margins above and below a box
not showing.
Vertical margins collapse. p 308

My content does not fit in the
containing box/browser window.
You can deal with this using the
overflow property. p 306, 316

Boxes look a different size in IE.
Some versions of IE use a
different box model than all
other browsers. Use a **DOCTYPE**
declaration to make old versions
of IE behave like other browsers.
p 316

Boxes do not appear centered
when using **auto** for left and
right margins.
You may need to use the
**text-align** property on the
containing element. p 315

Elements are overlapping.
When you take elements out of
normal flow, they can overlap.
**z-index** helps you control which
item goes on top. p 369

Why is the **vertical-align**
property not vertically centering
my block-level element?
This property is not designed for
this purpose. It is used to center
_inline_ elements on the page.
You will find several ways to
vertically center block-level
elements (depending on their
context) if you search on Google.

```
A background image is not
showing on my box.
Does the box you are applying
the style to to have a defined
height and width? p 303
```

```
Does the containing box have an
overflow property set to auto?
p 373, 374
```

```
My background images do not
show when the page is printed.
Most browsers do not print
background images by default to
help save ink. You can adjust this
in your print preferences.
```

```
There is a gap between the
browser window and my
content.
You may need to set margin and
padding on the <body> element
to 0. p 313, 314
```

```
FLOAT In LAYOUT
A box is not sitting next to
another floated element.
Ensure that there is enough
space in the containing element
for the two to sit side by side.
p 303
```

```
Margins and padding are added
to the width of the box (except
for older versions of IE, which
have a different box model).
Therefore, the box might be
wider than specified in the width
property. p 316
```

```
Did you specify a width for the
floated element? (See next
point.)
```

```
My floated element takes up the
full width of the browser window
(or containing box).
Check that you have specified
a width for the floated element.
p 371
```

```
The container around my floated
elements are one pixel tall.
The containing element doesn't
know the height of the floated
elements inside it. You can
either add an element that acts
as a clearing box or use the
overflow property with a value
set to auto. p 373
```

```
IE added an extra margin to my
floated elements.
Set the display property to
inline.
